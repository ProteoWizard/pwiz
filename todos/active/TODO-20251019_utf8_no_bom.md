# TODO-20251019_utf8_no_bom.md

## Branch Information
- **Branch**: `Skyline/work/20251019_utf8_no_bom`
- **Created**: 2025-10-19
- **Objective**: Standardize all source files to UTF-8 without BOM

## Background
Modern best practice is **UTF-8 without BOM** for source code. BOM can cause issues with:
- Unix/Linux build tools
- Git diffs and merges
- Some compilers and parsers
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Current State (Analysis Results - 2025-10-19)

**Analysis of 13,571 Git-tracked files:**
- **Total analyzed**: 13,562 files
- **Files WITH BOM**: 3,439 (25.36%)
- **Files WITHOUT BOM**: 10,123 (74.64%)
- **Binary/unreadable**: 0

**Files WITH BOM by extension:**
- `.cs`: 2,818 files (81.9% of BOM files)
- `.csproj`: 109 files
- `.view`: 100 files
- `.xsd`: 68 files
- `.sln`: 60 files
- `.sky`: 49 files
- `.config`: 35 files
- `.resx`: 35 files
- Other extensions: 165 files

**Key Findings:**
- C# source files (`.cs`) account for the vast majority of BOM usage
- Project/solution files also have BOM
- Some data files (`.sky`, `.view`) have BOM
- Complete list exported to `files-with-bom.txt` (3,439 files)

## Task Checklist

### Phase 1: Analysis
- [x] Run `analyze-bom-git.ps1` to get current statistics
- [x] Review `files-with-bom.txt` for complete file list
- [x] Identify any files that MUST keep BOM (if any)
- [x] Document current state in this TODO

**Files That Can Safely Have BOM Removed:**
- `.cs` files (2,818) - C# source code
- `.csproj`, `.sln` files (169) - MSBuild project files
- `.resx` files (35) - Resource files (XML-based)
- `.config` files (35) - Configuration files
- `.xsd`, `.xml` files (99) - XML schema and data files
- `.cpp` files (3) - C++ source code

**Files Requiring Special Consideration:**
- `.tli`, `.tlh` files (5) - Type library headers (auto-generated by Visual Studio from COM)
  - **Decision**: EXCLUDE - These are auto-generated by Visual Studio and should not be manually modified
- `.sky`, `.skyl`, `.skyr` files (54) - Skyline document files
  - **Decision**: SAFE TO CONVERT - These are XML-based Skyline documents
- `.view` files (100) - Skyline view configuration files
  - **Decision**: SAFE TO CONVERT - These are also XML-based

**Files to EXCLUDE from BOM removal:**
- Auto-generated COM type library files: `*.tli`, `*.tlh` (5 files)
  - These are regenerated by Visual Studio and should match IDE output

**Summary:**
- **Files to convert**: 3,434 files
- **Files to exclude**: 5 files (.tli/.tlh)

### Phase 2: Tooling
- [ ] Create `remove-bom.ps1` script to strip BOM from files
  - Preserve file timestamps where possible
  - Handle files in use gracefully
  - Validate conversion success
  - Support dry-run mode for testing
- [ ] Test script on small subset of files
- [ ] Verify Git diff shows only BOM removal (no content changes)

### Phase 3: Conversion
- [ ] Create test branch and convert subset of files
- [ ] Build and run tests to verify no regressions
- [ ] Visual Studio verification - files open correctly
- [ ] Convert all remaining files
- [ ] Run full test suite on all platforms

### Phase 4: Prevention
- [ ] Add UTF-8 without BOM guideline to STYLEGUIDE.md
- [ ] Document Visual Studio configuration for new files
- [ ] Consider pre-commit hook to prevent BOM reintroduction
- [ ] Update this TODO with final statistics

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove `todos/active/files-with-bom.txt` (no longer needed)
- [ ] Move TODO file to `todos/completed/` before merging
- [ ] Keep `analyze-bom-git.ps1` and `remove-bom.ps1` for future verification

## Tools & Scripts
- **`scripts/misc/analyze-bom-git.ps1`** - Analysis script (keep permanently)
- **`scripts/misc/remove-bom.ps1`** - BOM removal script (keep permanently)
- **`todos/active/files-with-bom.txt`** - Complete list of 3,439 files with BOM (REMOVE before completing TODO)

## Risks & Considerations
- **Large commit**: May affect hundreds of files
- **Merge conflicts**: Active branches will need coordination
- **Third-party tools**: Some Windows tools default to UTF-8 with BOM
- **Localization**: Verify `.resx` files handle encoding correctly
- **Timing**: Coordinate with team to minimize disruption

## Success Criteria
- All source files standardized to UTF-8 without BOM
- No build or test failures
- Guidelines prevent regression
- Analysis script confirms BOM-free status

## Handoff Prompt for Branch Creation

```
I want to start work on UTF-8 BOM standardization.

Please:
1. Create branch: Skyline/work/YYYYMMDD_utf8_no_bom (use today's date)
2. Rename TODO-utf8_no_bom.md to TODO-YYYYMMDD_utf8_no_bom.md
3. Run .\analyze-bom-git.ps1 and update the TODO with current statistics
4. Begin Phase 1: Analysis

The TODO file contains full context. Let's start by understanding the current state of BOM usage.

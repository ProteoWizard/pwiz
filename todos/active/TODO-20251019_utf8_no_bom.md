# TODO-20251019_utf8_no_bom.md

## Branch Information
- **Branch**: `Skyline/work/20251019_utf8_no_bom`
- **Created**: 2025-10-19
- **Objective**: Standardize all source files to UTF-8 without BOM

## Background
Modern best practice is **UTF-8 without BOM** for source code. BOM can cause issues with:
- Unix/Linux build tools
- Git diffs and merges
- Some compilers and parsers
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Current State (Analysis Results - 2025-10-19)

**Analysis of 13,571 Git-tracked files:**
- **Total analyzed**: 13,562 files
- **Files WITH BOM**: 3,439 (25.36%)
- **Files WITHOUT BOM**: 10,123 (74.64%)
- **Binary/unreadable**: 0

**Files WITH BOM by extension:**
- `.cs`: 2,818 files (81.9% of BOM files)
- `.csproj`: 109 files
- `.view`: 100 files
- `.xsd`: 68 files
- `.sln`: 60 files
- `.sky`: 49 files
- `.config`: 35 files
- `.resx`: 35 files
- Other extensions: 165 files

**Key Findings:**
- C# source files (`.cs`) account for the vast majority of BOM usage
- Project/solution files also have BOM
- Some data files (`.sky`, `.view`) have BOM
- Complete list exported to `files-with-bom.txt` (3,439 files)

## Task Checklist

### Phase 1: Analysis
- [x] Run `analyze-bom-git.ps1` to get current statistics
- [x] Review `files-with-bom.txt` for complete file list
- [x] Identify any files that MUST keep BOM (if any)
- [x] Document current state in this TODO

**Files That Can Safely Have BOM Removed:**
- `.cs` files (2,818) - C# source code
- `.csproj`, `.sln` files (169) - MSBuild project files
- `.resx` files (35) - Resource files (XML-based)
- `.config` files (35) - Configuration files
- `.xsd`, `.xml` files (99) - XML schema and data files
- `.cpp` files (3) - C++ source code

**Files Requiring Special Consideration:**
- `.tli`, `.tlh` files (5) - Type library headers (auto-generated by Visual Studio from COM)
  - **Decision**: EXCLUDE - These are auto-generated by Visual Studio and should not be manually modified
- `.sky`, `.skyl`, `.skyr` files (54) - Skyline document files
  - **Decision**: SAFE TO CONVERT - These are XML-based Skyline documents
- `.view` files (100) - Skyline view configuration files
  - **Decision**: SAFE TO CONVERT - These are also XML-based

**Files to EXCLUDE from BOM removal:**
- Auto-generated COM type library files: `*.tli`, `*.tlh` (5 files)
  - These are regenerated by Visual Studio and should match IDE output

**Summary:**
- **Files to convert**: 3,434 files
- **Files to exclude**: 5 files (.tli/.tlh)

### Phase 2: Tooling
- [ ] Create `remove-bom.ps1` script to strip BOM from files
  - Preserve file timestamps where possible
  - Handle files in use gracefully
  - Validate conversion success
  - Support dry-run mode for testing
- [ ] Test script on small subset of files
- [ ] Verify Git diff shows only BOM removal (no content changes)

### Phase 3: Conversion
- [ ] Create test branch and convert subset of files
- [ ] Build and run tests to verify no regressions
- [ ] Visual Studio verification - files open correctly
- [ ] Convert all remaining files
- [ ] Run full test suite on all platforms

### Phase 4: Prevention
- [ ] Add UTF-8 without BOM guideline to STYLEGUIDE.md
- [ ] Document Visual Studio configuration for new files
- [x] Add BOM check to CodeInspectionTest.cs
  - Added `InspectUtf8Bom()` method in CodeInspectionTest.cs
  - Automatically removes BOM when found (similar to SchemaDocumentsTest)
  - Checks files by reading first 3 bytes (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF)
  - Excludes auto-generated files: `*.tli`, `*.tlh`
  - Provides clear error message with list of fixed files
  - Covers Skyline and Shared directories
- [ ] Consider pre-commit hook for broader project coverage
- [ ] Update this TODO with final statistics

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove `todos/active/files-with-bom.txt` (no longer needed)
- [ ] Move TODO file to `todos/completed/` before merging
- [ ] Keep `analyze-bom-git.ps1` and `remove-bom.ps1` for future verification

## Tools & Scripts
- **`scripts/misc/analyze-bom-git.ps1`** - Analysis script (keep permanently)
  - Now accepts optional `-OutputFile` parameter
  - No longer creates files-with-bom.txt at root by default
- **`scripts/misc/remove-bom.ps1`** - BOM removal script (keep permanently)
- **`scripts/misc/validate-bom-compliance.ps1`** - Validation script (keep permanently)
  - Checks against approved list of 11 files allowed to have BOM
  - Returns exit code 0 if compliant, 1 if unexpected BOMs found
  - Ready for use in CI or commit hooks
- **`todos/active/original-files-with-bom.txt`** - Original list of 3,439 files with BOM (keep for reference)

## Risks & Considerations
- **Large commit**: May affect hundreds of files
- **Merge conflicts**: Active branches will need coordination
- **Third-party tools**: Some Windows tools default to UTF-8 with BOM
- **Localization**: Verify `.resx` files handle encoding correctly
- **Timing**: Coordinate with team to minimize disruption

## Success Criteria
- All source files standardized to UTF-8 without BOM
- No build or test failures
- Guidelines prevent regression
- Analysis script confirms BOM-free status

## Future Work: CI Integration (Out of Scope for Current Branch)

The `validate-bom-compliance.ps1` script is ready for CI integration but requires significant additional work:

**Key Challenge: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- ProteoWizard builds on Windows, Linux, and macOS (hence Boost.Build)
- Current validation script is PowerShell (Windows-only)
- Any CI integration must work across all three platforms
- Commit hooks must be cross-platform (bash scripts work everywhere, PowerShell doesn't)
- This complexity is why we defer to future work with proper planning

Current script provides immediate value for Windows development (where most Skyline work happens), but ProteoWizard-level CI integration requires a proper cross-platform solution.

Consider for future TODO:

### Option 1: Boost.Build/Jam Integration
Add BOM validation test to pwiz test suite (runs on TeamCity alongside Reader_Agilent_Test, etc.):
- Create C++ wrapper executable: `scripts/misc/bom-validation-test.cpp`
  - Calls PowerShell script via `std::system()`
  - Returns proper exit codes (0 = pass, 1 = fail)
- Add to appropriate Jamfile.jam (likely `pwiz/utility/misc/Jamfile.jam` or root `Jamroot.jam`)
  - Use `run-if-exists` rule for Windows-only execution
  - Example: `run-if-exists bom-validation-test.cpp : : : : bom-validation-test ;`
- Requires coordination with Boost.Build expert (Matt)

### Option 2: Git Commit Hook
Simpler alternative for immediate protection:
- Create `.githooks/pre-commit` template with setup instructions
- Developers opt-in by running: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
- **Challenge**: Hook must work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
  - Would need bash script that detects platform
  - Calls PowerShell on Windows, needs alternate implementation on Unix
  - Still requires cross-platform solution

### Option 3: GitHub Actions / CI Script
If project moves to GitHub Actions or similar:
- Add BOM validation as separate CI job
- Runs on every PR
- Fails PR if unexpected BOMs found

**Recommendation**: All options require cross-platform solution. Best approach:
1. Document the requirement clearly (this TODO)
2. Create a separate TODO for cross-platform CI integration
3. Coordinate with Matt (Boost.Build expert) for proper implementation
4. Consider Python-based solution (works everywhere) instead of PowerShell/bash

For now, the validation script provides value for manual Windows-based verification and documents the approved BOM list.

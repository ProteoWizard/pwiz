      <H3><A name="synopsis"></A>Synopsis</H3>
      <P>The Perl regular expression syntax is based on that used by the programming 
         language <EM>Perl</EM> .&nbsp; Perl regular expressions are the default 
         behavior in Boost.Regex or you can&nbsp;pass the flag <EM>perl</EM> to the 
         regex constructor, for example:</P>
      <PRE>// e1 is a case sensitive Perl regular expression: 
// since Perl is the default option there's no need to explicitly specify the syntax used here:
boost::regex e1(my_expression);
// e2 a case insensitive Perl regular expression:
boost::regex e2(my_expression, boost::regex::perl|boost::regex::icase);</PRE>
      <H3>Perl&nbsp;Regular Expression Syntax<A name="Perl"></A></H3>
      <P>In&nbsp;Perl regular expressions, all characters match themselves except for 
         the following special characters:</P>
      <PRE>.[{()\*+?|^$</PRE>
      <H4>Wildcard:</H4>
      <P>The single character '.' when used outside of a character set will match any 
         single character except:</P>
      <P>The NULL character when the flag <EM>match_no_dot_null</EM> is passed to the 
         matching algorithms.</P>
      <P>The newline character when the flag <EM>match_not_dot_newline</EM> is passed to 
         the matching algorithms.</P>
      <H4>Anchors:</H4>
      <P>A '^' character shall match the start of a line.</P>
      <P>A '$' character shall match the end of a line.</P>
      <H4>Marked sub-expressions:</H4>
      <P>A section beginning ( and ending ) acts as a marked sub-expression.&nbsp; 
         Whatever matched the sub-expression is split out in a separate field by the 
         matching algorithms.&nbsp; Marked sub-expressions can also repeated, or 
         referred to by a back-reference.</P>
      <H4>Non-marking grouping:</H4>
      <P>A marked sub-expression is useful to lexically group part of a regular 
         expression, but has the side-effect of spitting out an extra field in the 
         result.&nbsp; As an alternative&nbsp;you can lexically group part of a regular 
         expression, without generating a marked sub-expression by using (?: and ) , for 
         example (?:ab)+ will repeat "ab" without splitting out any separate 
         sub-expressions.</P>
      <H4>Repeats:</H4>
      <P>Any atom (a single character, a marked sub-expression, or a character class) 
         can be repeated with the *, +, ?, and {}&nbsp;operators.</P>
      <P>The * operator will match the preceding atom zero or more times, for example 
         the expression a*b will match any of the following:</P>
      <PRE>b
ab
aaaaaaaab</PRE>
      <P>The + operator will match the preceding atom one or more times, for example the 
         expression a+b will match any of the following:</P>
      <PRE>ab
aaaaaaaab</PRE>
      <P>But will not match:</P>
      <PRE>b</PRE>
      <P>The ? operator will match the preceding atom zero or&nbsp;one times, for 
         example the expression ca?b will match any of the following:</P>
      <PRE>cb
cab</PRE>
      <P>But will not match:</P>
      <PRE>caab</PRE>
      <P>An atom can also be repeated with a bounded repeat:</P>
      <P>a{n}&nbsp; Matches 'a' repeated exactly <EM>n</EM> times.</P>
      <P>a{n,}&nbsp; Matches 'a' repeated <EM>n</EM> or more times.</P>
      <P>a{n, m}&nbsp; Matches 'a' repeated between <EM>n</EM> and <EM>m</EM> times 
         inclusive.</P>
      <P>For example:</P>
      <PRE>^a{2,3}$</PRE>
      <P>Will match either of:</P>
      <PRE>aa
aaa</PRE>
      <P>But neither of:</P>
      <PRE>a
aaaa</PRE>
      <P>It is an error to use a repeat operator, if the preceding construct can not be 
         repeated, for example:</P>
      <PRE>a(*)</PRE>
      <P>Will raise an error, as there is nothing for the * operator to be applied to.</P>
      <H4>Non greedy repeats</H4>
      <P>The normal repeat operators are "greedy", that is to say they will consume as 
         much input as possible.&nbsp; There are non-greedy versions available that will 
         consume as little input as possible while still producing a match.</P>
      <P>*? Matches the previous atom zero or more times, while consuming as little 
         input as possible.</P>
      <P>+? Matches the previous atom one or more times, while consuming as little input 
         as possible.</P>
      <P>?? Matches the previous atom zero or one times, while consuming as little input 
         as possible.</P>
      <P>{n,}? Matches the previous atom <EM>n</EM> or more times, while&nbsp;consuming 
         as little input as possible.</P>
      <P>{n,m}? Matches the previous atom between <EM>n</EM> and <EM>m</EM> times, 
         while&nbsp;consuming as little input as possible.</P>
      <H4>Back references:</H4>
      <P>An escape character followed by a digit <EM>n</EM>, where <EM>n </EM>is in the 
         range 1-9, matches the same string that was matched by sub-expression <EM>n</EM>.&nbsp; 
         For example the expression:</P>
      <PRE>^(a*).*\1$</PRE>
      <P>Will match the string:</P>
      <PRE>aaabbaaa</PRE>
      <P>But not the string:</P>
      <PRE>aaabba</PRE>
      <H4>Alternation</H4>
      <P>The | operator will match either of its arguments, so for example: abc|def will 
         match either "abc" or "def".&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>Parenthesis can be used to group alternations, for example: ab(d|ef) will match 
         either of "abd" or "abef".</P>
      <P>Empty&nbsp;alternatives are not allowed (these are almost always a mistake), 
         but if you really want an empty alternative use (?:) as a placeholder, for 
         example:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
         <P>"|abc" is not a valid expression, but<BR>
            "(?:)|abc" is and is equivalent, also the expression:<BR>
            "(?:abc)??" has exactly the same effect.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H4>Character sets:</H4>
      <P>A character set is a bracket-expression starting with [ and ending with ], it 
         defines a set of characters, and matches any single character that is a member 
         of that set.</P>
      <P>A bracket expression may contain any combination of the following:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
         <H5>Single characters:</H5>
         <P>For example [abc], will match any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.</P>
         <H5>Character ranges:</H5>
         <P>For example [a-c] will match any single character in the range 'a' to 
            'c'.&nbsp; By default, for POSIX-Perl regular expressions, a character <EM>x</EM>
            is within the range <EM>y</EM> to <EM>z</EM>, if it collates within that 
            range;&nbsp;this results in locale specific behavior.&nbsp; This behavior can 
            be turned off by unsetting the <EM><A href="syntax_option_type.html#Perl">collate</A></EM>
            option flag - in which case whether a character appears within a range is 
            determined by comparing the code points of the characters only</P>
         <H5>Negation:</H5>
         <P>If the bracket-expression begins with the ^ character, then it matches the 
            complement of the characters it contains, for example [^a-c] matches any 
            character that is not in the range a-c.</P>
         <H5>Character classes:</H5>
         <P>An expression of the form [[:name:]] matches the named character class "name", 
            for example [[:lower:]] matches any lower case character.&nbsp; See <A href="character_class_names.html">
               character class names</A>.</P>
         <H5>Collating Elements:</H5>
         <P>An expression of the form [[.col.] matches the collating element <EM>col</EM>.&nbsp; 
            A collating element is any single character, or any sequence of characters that 
            collates as a single unit.&nbsp; Collating elements may also be used as the end 
            point of a range, for example: [[.ae.]-c] matches the character sequence "ae", 
            plus any single character in the range "ae"-c, assuming that "ae" is treated as 
            a single collating element in the current locale.</P>
         <P>As an extension, a collating element may also be specified via it's <A href="collating_names.html">
               symbolic name</A>, for example:</P>
         <P>[[.NUL.]]</P>
         <P>matches a NUL character.</P>
         <H5>Equivalence classes:</H5>
         <P>
            An expression oftheform[[=col=]], matches any character or collating element 
            whose primary sort key is the same as that for collating element <EM>col</EM>, 
            as with colating elements the name <EM>col</EM> may be a <A href="collating_names.html">
               symbolic name</A>.&nbsp; A primary sort key is one that ignores case, 
            accentation, or locale-specific tailorings; so for example [[=a=]] matches any 
            of the characters: a, à, á, â, ã, ä, å, A, À, Á, Â, Ã, Ä and Å.&nbsp; 
            Unfortunately implementation of this is reliant on the platform's collation and 
            localisation support; this feature can not be relied upon to work portably 
            across all platforms, or even all locales on one platform.</P>
         <H5>Escapes:</H5>
         <P>All the escape sequences that match a single character, or a single character 
            class are permitted within a character class definition, <EM>except</EM> the 
            negated character classes (\D \W etc).</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H5>Combinations:</H5>
      <P>All of the above can be combined in one character set declaration, for example: 
         [[:digit:]a-c[.NUL.]].</P>
      <H4>Escapes</H4>
      <P>Any special character preceded by an escape shall match itself.
      </P>
      <P>The following escape sequences are also supported:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
         <H5>Escapes matching a specific character</H5>
         <P>The following escape sequences are all synonyms for single characters:</P>

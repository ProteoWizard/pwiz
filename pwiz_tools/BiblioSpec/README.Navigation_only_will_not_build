This is a note about the .sln file in this directory.

It's just there as a code navigation aid - Intellisense understands enough of the code without compilation to be useful, but you still need bjam to actually build.

It's also useful for debugging if you set the debug properties to point whereever bjam built the BibilioSpec component you're working on. You can set breakpoints and everything.

    /// Some notes on the protdb contents, provided by Jarret E. :
    /// HOP1 -- this protein has no isoforms, and is only present in yeast.
    /// PLMN -- this protein is only present in human and mouse (it's in the blood), not in yeast.
    /// ATPB -- this protein is present in yeast, mouse, and human, and is highly conserved (i.e. the sequence between the three is very similar)
    /// HPT and HPTR -- HPT (haptoglobin) is a protein that is present in both human and mouse (not yeast).  In humans, there are two isoforms of HPT, in mouse there's only one.  Additionally, HPT is very similar to another protein in human -- HPTR.  Which I also include in the file.  Lots of peptides in common between HPT and HPTR
    /// TAU -- this protein is is seen in human, and mouse.  In both cases, there are a ton of isoforms (9 for human, 6 for mouse).

            NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

    DESCRIPTION:
    The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
    nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

    These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
    long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
    L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


    REQUIREMENTS:
    Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
    * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
    4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
       with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
    finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

    Description below contains information which is specific to this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
    information about creation of CG optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
       Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
       nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

    There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
    same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related

    Suggested  step  length  is used as starting point for the line search. It

    (which is used as initial estimate for the first step) is many  orders  of
    magnitude different from the desired step.

    Line search  may  fail  on  such problems without good estimate of initial
    step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
    step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,

       function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
       (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass
       gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to  exception  being
       thrown. Either  you  did  not  pass  gradient when it WAS needed or you
       passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

    NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It

                         BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
           WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

    DESCRIPTION:
    The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
    combination of:
    * bound constraints
    * linear inequality constraints
    * linear equality constraints

    REQUIREMENTS:
    * user must provide function value and gradient
    * starting point X0 must be feasible or
      not too far away from the feasible set
    * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
      L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
    * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

    USAGE:

    Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
    Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
    you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
    on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

    2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
       MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

    3. User sets stopping conditions for underlying unconstrained solver
       with MinBLEICSetInnerCond() call.
       This function controls accuracy of underlying optimization algorithm.

    4. User sets stopping conditions for outer iteration by calling
       MinBLEICSetOuterCond() function.
       This function controls handling of boundary and inequality constraints.

    5. Additionally, user may set limit on number of internal iterations
       by MinBLEICSetMaxIts() call.
       This function allows to prevent algorithm from looping forever.

    6. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

    7. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

    8. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N but another starting point.
       MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
        X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                    * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                    * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                      to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                      approximation.

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure stores algorithm state

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
    finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

    Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
    only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
    more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
       gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
       problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    NOTE 1: linear (non-bound) constraints are satisfied only approximately:
    * there always exists some minor violation (about Epsilon in magnitude)
      due to rounding errors
    * numerical differentiation, if used, may  lead  to  function  evaluations
      outside  of the feasible  area,   because   algorithm  does  NOT  change
      numerical differentiation formula according to linear constraints.
    If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your
    problem  in  such  manner  that  all constraints will become boundary ones
    (this kind of constraints is always satisfied exactly, both in  the  final
    solution and in all intermediate points).

    This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
    along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

    In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
    preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
    preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
    functions.

    There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
    coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
    mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the

      * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
        where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
        of i-th parameter
      * if needed, steps are bounded with respect to constraints on X[]
      * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
        point
      * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
        some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
        Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative.
    * after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

    NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It
            is very costly and you should use  it  only  for  low  dimensional
            problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
            calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You  should  not use it in the
            production code (unless you want to check derivatives provided  by
            some third party).

    NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
            (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
            lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
            parameters by means of setting scale with MinBLEICSetScale().

    NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
            I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
            step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
            sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
            function.

            LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

    DESCRIPTION:
    The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
    Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
    of memory.
    The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
    using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
    It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
    value of order 2*N*M.


    REQUIREMENTS:
    Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
    * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
       and other functions
    3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
       pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
    4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem
       with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   problem dimension. N>0
        M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                    approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                    value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                    considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                    performance. M<=N.
        X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state


    NOTES:
    1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
    2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
       optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
       use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
       L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

    The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses

        DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
    2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
       S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
    3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
       large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
       step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
       value to start with.
    4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
       calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
       any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
       However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
       small ones.
       We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
       is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
       Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
       nonlinear problems.
       Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
       dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
       as possible.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step

    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is

    This family of functions is used to launcn iterations of nonlinear optimizer

    These functions accept following parameters:
        func    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                    value func at given point x
        grad    -   callback which calculates function (or merit function)
                    value func and gradient grad at given point x
        rep     -   optional callback which is called after each iteration
                    can be null
        obj     -   optional object which is passed to func/grad/hess/jac/rep
                    can be null

    NOTES:

    1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
       (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
       only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
       gradient.

       Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
       (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
       for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
       MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
       which accepts function ONLY.

       Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
       your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
       callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific
       function used to create optimizer.


                         |         USER PASSED TO MinLBFGSOptimize()

       MinLBFGSCreateF() |     work                FAIL
       MinLBFGSCreate()  |     FAIL                work

       Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
       function  and  MinLBFGSOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
       combination (for example, to create optimizer with MinLBFGSCreateF() and
       to pass gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to exception
       being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS needed or
       you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

    NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It

    NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
            (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
            lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
            parameters by means of setting scale with MinLBFGSSetScale().

    NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
            I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
            step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
            sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding

                    If some (all) variables are unbounded, you may specify
                    very large number or +INF (latter is recommended because
                    it will allow solver to use better algorithm).

    NOTE: it is possible to specify BndL[i]=BndU[i]. In this case I-th
    variable will be "frozen" at X[i]=BndL[i]=BndU[i].

                    IMPROVED LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT METHOD FOR
                     NON-LINEAR LEAST SQUARES OPTIMIZATION

    DESCRIPTION:
    This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
    sum of squares:
        F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])
    using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].


    REQUIREMENTS:
    This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

    * function vector f[] at given point X
    * function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

    There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
    correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
    unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
    First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
    f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

    You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
    use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
    works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
    will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
    Jacobian.


    USAGE:
    1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
    2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
       other functions
    3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
       callback functions.
    4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
    5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
       with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
       MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


    INPUT PARAMETERS:
        N       -   dimension, N>1
                    * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                    * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
        M       -   number of functions f[i]
        X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

    OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
        State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

    NOTES:
    1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
    2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
       optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
       use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

    This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

    ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
    size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
    the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
    a) "how large" the variable is
    b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

    Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
    optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
    condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

    Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
    important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
    easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
    stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
    relaxed stopping conditions).

    This function is used to change acceleration settings

    You can choose between three acceleration strategies:
    * AccType=0, no acceleration.
    * AccType=1, secant updates are used to update quadratic model after  each
      iteration. After fixed number of iterations (or after  model  breakdown)
      we  recalculate  quadratic  model  using  analytic  Jacobian  or  finite
      differences. Number of secant-based iterations depends  on  optimization
      settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
      iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

    AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost  is  prohibitive
    high (several Mx1 function vector calculations  followed  by  several  NxN
    Cholesky factorizations are faster than calculation of one M*N  Jacobian).
    It should also be used when we have no Jacobian, because finite difference
    approximation takes too much time to compute.

    MinLMCreateXYZ) and acceleration types they support (and use by  default).

    NOTES:

    1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
       may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
       said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
       different sets of callbacks.

       This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
       MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
       does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
       will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

       Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
       compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

    This  subroutine  turns  on  verification  of  the  user-supplied analytic
    gradient:
    * user calls this subroutine before optimization begins
    * MinLMOptimize() is called
    * prior to actual optimization, for  each  function Fi and each  component
      of parameters  being  optimized X[j] algorithm performs following steps:
      * two trial steps are made to X[j]-TestStep*S[j] and X[j]+TestStep*S[j],
        where X[j] is j-th parameter and S[j] is a scale of j-th parameter
      * if needed, steps are bounded with respect to constraints on X[]
      * Fi(X) is evaluated at these trial points
      * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
      * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
        points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
        point
      * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
        some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
        Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative,
        Rep.FuncIdx is set to index of the function.
    * after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

    NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) Jacobian evaluations. It
            is  very  costly  and  you  should use it only for low dimensional
            problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
            calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You should not  use  it in the
            production code  (unless  you  want  to check derivatives provided
            by some third party).

    NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
            (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
            lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
            parameters by means of setting scale with MinLMSetScale().

    NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
            I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
            step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
            sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
            function.

        State       -   structure used to store algorithm state

        This function projects gradient into feasible area of boundary constrained

        components bounded by BL/BU, and next NSlack ones bounded by non-negativity
        constraints.

        INPUT PARAMETERS

            HaveBL  -   if HaveBL[i] is False, then i-th bound is not present
            BU      -   upper bounds (may contain +INF, when bound is not present)
            HaveBU  -   if HaveBU[i] is False, then i-th bound is not present

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS
            G       -   projection of G. Components of G which satisfy one of the
                        following
                            (1) (X[I]<=BndL[I]) and (G[I]>0), OR
                            (2) (X[I]>=BndU[I]) and (G[I]<0)
                        are replaced by zeros.

        NOTE 1: this function assumes that constraints are feasible. It throws
        exception otherwise.

        NOTE 2: in fact, projection of ANTI-gradient is calculated,  because  this
        function trims components of -G which points outside of the feasible area.
        However, working with -G is considered confusing, because all optimization
        source work with G.

        Given
            a) initial point X0[NMain+NSlack]
               (feasible with respect to bound constraints)
            b) step vector alpha*D[NMain+NSlack]
            c) boundary constraints BndL[NMain], BndU[NMain]
            d) implicit non-negativity constraints for slack variables
        this  function  calculates  bound  on  the step length subject to boundary
        constraints.

        It returns:
            *  MaxStepLen - such step length that X0+MaxStepLen*alpha*D is exactly
               at the boundary given by constraints
            *  VariableToFreeze - index of the constraint to be activated,
               0 <= VariableToFreeze < NMain+NSlack
            *  ValueToFreeze - value of the corresponding constraint.

        Notes:
            * it is possible that several constraints can be activated by the step
              at once. In such cases only one constraint is returned. It is caller
              responsibility to check other constraints. This function makes  sure
              that we activate at least one constraint, and everything else is the
              responsibility of the caller.
            * steps smaller than MaxStepLen still can activate constraints due  to
              numerical errors. Thus purpose of this  function  is  not  to  guard 
              against accidental activation of the constraints - quite the reverse, 
              its purpose is to activate at least constraint upon performing  step
              which is too long.
            * in case there is no constraints to activate, we return negative
              VariableToFreeze and zero MaxStepLen and ValueToFreeze.
            * this function assumes that constraints are consistent; it throws
              exception otherwise.

                NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD

        DESCRIPTION:
        The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by using one of  the
        nonlinear conjugate gradient methods.

        These CG methods are globally convergent (even on non-convex functions) as
        long as grad(f) is Lipschitz continuous in  a  some  neighborhood  of  the
        L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }.


        REQUIREMENTS:
        Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
        * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinCGCreate() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinCGSetCond(), MinCGSetStpMax() and
           other functions
        3. User calls MinCGOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state   and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
        4. User calls MinCGResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally, user may call MinCGRestartFrom() to solve another  problem
           with same N but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinCGRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinCGCreate(). It uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinCGCreate() in order to get more
        information about creation of CG optimizer.

            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinCGSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust  and  precise.  L-BFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
           Imprecise  gradient may slow down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
           nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for CG optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of CG optimizer  -  step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In   most   optimizers  (and  in  the  CG  too)  scaling is NOT a form  of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner by separate call to one of the MinCGSetPrec...() functions.

        There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        step length. Imagine, for example, problem with ||grad||=10^50 and desired
        step equal to 0.1 Line  search function will use 10^50  as  initial  step,
        then  it  will  decrease step length by 2 (up to 20 attempts) and will get

        This function allows us to tell than line search should  be  started  from

        Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

        This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate
        diagonal of Hessian, but you know that your  variables  are  badly  scaled
        (for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),
        and most part of the ill-conditioning comes from different scales of vars.

        In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),
        can greatly improve convergence.

        IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables with MinCGSetScale() call
        (before or after MinCGSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of the scale
        of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be just unit matrix.

        NOTES:

        1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
           (analytical) user-supplied  gradient, and one which uses function value
           only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
           gradient.
           
           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           (either MinCGCreate()  for analytical gradient  or  MinCGCreateF()  for
           numerical differentiation) you should  choose  appropriate  variant  of
           MinCGOptimize() - one which accepts function AND gradient or one  which
           accepts function ONLY.

           Be careful to choose variant of MinCGOptimize()  which  corresponds  to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed  to  MinCGOptimize()  and  specific
           function used to create optimizer.

           MinCGCreate()  |     FAIL                work

           Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
           function and MinCGOptimize() version. Attemps to use  such  combination
           (for  example,  to create optimizer with  MinCGCreateF()  and  to  pass
           gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to  exception  being
           thrown. Either  you  did  not  pass  gradient when it WAS needed or you
           passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

        This function sets low-rank preconditioner for Hessian matrix  H=D+V'*C*V,

        * H is a Hessian matrix, which is approximated by D/V/C
        * D=D1+D2 is a diagonal matrix, which includes two positive definite terms:
          * constant term D1 (is not updated or infrequently updated)
          * variable term D2 (can be cheaply updated from iteration to iteration)
        * V is a low-rank correction
        * C is a diagonal factor of low-rank correction

        Preconditioner P is calculated using approximate Woodburry formula:
            P  = D^(-1) - D^(-1)*V'*(C^(-1)+V*D1^(-1)*V')^(-1)*V*D^(-1)

        Note that B is calculated using constant term (D1) only,  which  allows us
        to update D2 without recalculation of B or   VC.  Such  preconditioner  is
        exact when D2 is zero. When D2 is non-zero, it is only approximation,  but
        very good and cheap one.

        This function accepts D1, V, C.
        D2 is set to zero by default.

        Cost of this update is O(N*VCnt*VCnt), but D2 can be updated in just O(N)
        by MinCGSetPrecVarPart.

            where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
            of i-th parameter
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point

        * after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

        NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It
                is very costly and you should use  it  only  for  low  dimensional
                problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
                calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You  should  not use it in the
                production code (unless you want to check derivatives provided  by
                some third party).

        NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
                (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
                lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
                parameters by means of setting scale with MinCGSetScale().

        NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
                I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
                step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
                sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
                function.

                             BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
               WITH ADDITIONAL LINEAR EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

        DESCRIPTION:
        The  subroutine  minimizes  function   F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
        combination of:
        * bound constraints
        * linear inequality constraints
        * linear equality constraints

        REQUIREMENTS:
        * user must provide function value and gradient
        * starting point X0 must be feasible or
          not too far away from the feasible set
        * grad(f) must be Lipschitz continuous on a level set:
          L = { x : f(x)<=f(x0) }
        * function must be defined everywhere on the feasible set F

        USAGE:

        Constrained optimization if far more complex than the unconstrained one.
        Here we give very brief outline of the BLEIC optimizer. We strongly recommend
        you to read examples in the ALGLIB Reference Manual and to read ALGLIB User Guide
        on optimization, which is available at http://www.alglib.net/optimization/

        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinBLEICCreate() call

        2. USer adds boundary and/or linear constraints by calling
           MinBLEICSetBC() and MinBLEICSetLC() functions.

        3. User sets stopping conditions for underlying unconstrained solver
           with MinBLEICSetInnerCond() call.
           This function controls accuracy of underlying optimization algorithm.

        4. User sets stopping conditions for outer iteration by calling
           MinBLEICSetOuterCond() function.
           This function controls handling of boundary and inequality constraints.

        5. Additionally, user may set limit on number of internal iterations
           by MinBLEICSetMaxIts() call.
           This function allows to prevent algorithm from looping forever.

        6. User calls MinBLEICOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.

        7. User calls MinBLEICResults() to get solution

        8. Optionally user may call MinBLEICRestartFrom() to solve another problem
           with same N but another starting point.
           MinBLEICRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
            X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                        * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                        * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                          to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                          approximation.

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure stores algorithm state

        /*************************************************************************
        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinBLEICCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinBLEICCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of BLEIC optimizer.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinBLEICSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is  less  robust and precise. CG needs exact gradient values. Imprecise
           gradient may slow  down  convergence, especially  on  highly  nonlinear
           problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        If you want constraints to be  satisfied  exactly, try to reformulate your

        This function sets scaling coefficients for BLEIC optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  BLEIC  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinBLEICSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There is a special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

           (either  MinBLEICCreate() for analytical gradient or  MinBLEICCreateF()
           for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
           MinBLEICOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
           which accepts function ONLY.

           Be careful to choose variant of MinBLEICOptimize() which corresponds to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of

          * two trial steps are made to X[i]-TestStep*S[i] and X[i]+TestStep*S[i],
            where X[i] is i-th component of the initial point and S[i] is a  scale
            of i-th parameter
          * if needed, steps are bounded with respect to constraints on X[]
          * F(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point
          * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
            some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
            Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative.
        * after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

        NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It
                is very costly and you should use  it  only  for  low  dimensional
                problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
                calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You  should  not use it in the
                production code (unless you want to check derivatives provided  by
                some third party).

        NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
                (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
                lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
                parameters by means of setting scale with MinBLEICSetScale().

        NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
                I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
                step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
                sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
                function.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
            TestStep    -   verification step:

        * modified barrier functions to handle inequality constraints
          (both F and G are modified)
        * projection of gradient into equality constrained subspace
          (only G is modified)
        * quadratic penalty for deviations from equality constrained subspace
          (both F and G are modified)

        different types of gradient), feasibility and complementary slackness
        errors.

            MBA     -   minimum argument of barrier functions.
                        If X is strictly feasible, it is greater than zero.

                LIMITED MEMORY BFGS METHOD FOR LARGE SCALE OPTIMIZATION

        DESCRIPTION:
        The subroutine minimizes function F(x) of N arguments by  using  a  quasi-
        Newton method (LBFGS scheme) which is optimized to use  a  minimum  amount
        of memory.
        The subroutine generates the approximation of an inverse Hessian matrix by
        using information about the last M steps of the algorithm  (instead of N).
        It lessens a required amount of memory from a value  of  order  N^2  to  a
        value of order 2*N*M.


        REQUIREMENTS:
        Algorithm will request following information during its operation:
        * function value F and its gradient G (simultaneously) at given point X


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLBFGSCreate() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLBFGSSetCond() MinLBFGSSetStpMax()
           and other functions
        3. User calls MinLBFGSOptimize() function which takes algorithm  state and
           pointer (delegate, etc.) to callback function which calculates F/G.
        4. User calls MinLBFGSResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally user may call MinLBFGSRestartFrom() to solve another problem

           MinLBFGSRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   problem dimension. N>0
            M       -   number of corrections in the BFGS scheme of Hessian
                        approximation update. Recommended value:  3<=M<=7. The smaller
                        value causes worse convergence, the bigger will  not  cause  a
                        considerably better convergence, but will cause a fall in  the
                        performance. M<=N.
            X       -   initial solution approximation, array[0..N-1].


        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state
            

        NOTES:
        1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLBFGSSetCond() function
        2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
           optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
           use MinLBFGSSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's  steps.  However,
           L-BFGS rarely needs such a tuning.

        The subroutine is finite difference variant of MinLBFGSCreate().  It  uses
        finite differences in order to differentiate target function.

        Description below contains information which is specific to  this function
        only. We recommend to read comments on MinLBFGSCreate() in  order  to  get
        more information about creation of LBFGS optimizer.

            X       -   starting point, array[0..N-1].
            DiffStep-   differentiation step, >0

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. algorithm uses 4-point central formula for differentiation.
        2. differentiation step along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I] where
           S[] is scaling vector which can be set by MinLBFGSSetScale() call.
        3. we recommend you to use moderate values of  differentiation  step.  Too
           large step will result in too large truncation  errors, while too small
           step will result in too large numerical  errors.  1.0E-6  can  be  good
           value to start with.
        4. Numerical  differentiation  is   very   inefficient  -   one   gradient
           calculation needs 4*N function evaluations. This function will work for
           any N - either small (1...10), moderate (10...100) or  large  (100...).
           However, performance penalty will be too severe for any N's except  for
           small ones.
           We should also say that code which relies on numerical  differentiation
           is   less  robust  and  precise.  LBFGS  needs  exact  gradient values.
           Imprecise gradient may slow  down  convergence,  especially  on  highly
           nonlinear problems.
           Thus  we  recommend to use this function for fast prototyping on small-
           dimensional problems only, and to implement analytical gradient as soon
           as possible.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for LBFGS optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Scaling is also used by finite difference variant of the optimizer  - step
        along I-th axis is equal to DiffStep*S[I].

        In  most  optimizers  (and  in  the  LBFGS  too)  scaling is NOT a form of
        preconditioning. It just  affects  stopping  conditions.  You  should  set
        preconditioner  by  separate  call  to  one  of  the  MinLBFGSSetPrec...()
        functions.

        There  is  special  preconditioning  mode, however,  which  uses   scaling
        coefficients to form diagonal preconditioning matrix. You  can  turn  this
        mode on, if you want.   But  you should understand that scaling is not the
        same thing as preconditioning - these are two different, although  related
        forms of tuning solver.

        Modification of the preconditioner: scale-based diagonal preconditioning.

        This preconditioning mode can be useful when you  don't  have  approximate
        diagonal of Hessian, but you know that your  variables  are  badly  scaled
        (for  example,  one  variable is in [1,10], and another in [1000,100000]),
        and most part of the ill-conditioning comes from different scales of vars.

        In this case simple  scale-based  preconditioner,  with H[i] = 1/(s[i]^2),
        can greatly improve convergence.

        IMPRTANT: you should set scale of your variables  with  MinLBFGSSetScale()
        call  (before  or after MinLBFGSSetPrecScale() call). Without knowledge of
        the scale of your variables scale-based preconditioner will be  just  unit
        matrix.

        NOTES:

        1. This function has two different implementations: one which  uses  exact
           (analytical) user-supplied gradient,  and one which uses function value
           only  and  numerically  differentiates  function  in  order  to  obtain
           gradient.

           Depending  on  the  specific  function  used to create optimizer object
           (either MinLBFGSCreate() for analytical gradient  or  MinLBFGSCreateF()
           for numerical differentiation) you should choose appropriate variant of
           MinLBFGSOptimize() - one  which  accepts  function  AND gradient or one
           which accepts function ONLY.

           Be careful to choose variant of MinLBFGSOptimize() which corresponds to
           your optimization scheme! Table below lists different  combinations  of
           callback (function/gradient) passed to MinLBFGSOptimize()  and specific
           function used to create optimizer.

           MinLBFGSCreate()  |     FAIL                work

           Here "FAIL" denotes inappropriate combinations  of  optimizer  creation
           function  and  MinLBFGSOptimize()  version.   Attemps   to   use   such
           combination (for example, to create optimizer with MinLBFGSCreateF() and
           to pass gradient information to MinCGOptimize()) will lead to exception
           being thrown. Either  you  did  not pass gradient when it WAS needed or
           you passed gradient when it was NOT needed.

        NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) gradient evaluations. It

        NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
                (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
                lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
                parameters by means of setting scale with MinLBFGSSetScale().

        NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
                I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
                step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too

        This function scales vector  by  multiplying it by inverse of the diagonal
        of the Hessian matrix. It should be used to  accelerate  steepest  descent
        phase of the QP solver.

        Although  it  is  called  "scale-grad",  it  can be called for any vector,
        whether it is gradient, anti-gradient, or just some vector.

        This function does NOT takes into account current set of  constraints,  it
        just performs matrix-vector multiplication  without  taking  into  account
        constraints.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            X       -   scaled vector
            
        NOTE:
            when called for non-SPD matrices, it silently skips components of X
            which correspond to zero or negative diagonal elements.
            
        NOTE:

        This subroutine calls CQMRebuild() and evaluates model at X subject to
        active constraints.

        It  is  intended  for  debug  purposes only, because it evaluates model by
        means of temporaries, which were calculated  by  CQMRebuild().  The   only
        purpose of this function  is  to  check  correctness  of  CQMRebuild()  by
        comparing results of this function with ones obtained by CQMEval(),  which
        is  used  as  reference  point. The  idea is that significant deviation in
        results  of  these  two  functions  is  evidence  of  some  error  in  the
        CQMRebuild().

        NOTE: suffix T denotes that temporaries marked by T-prefix are used. There
              is one more variant of this function, which uses  "effective"  model
              built by CQMRebuild().

        NOTE2: in case CQMRebuild() fails (due to model non-convexity), this
              function returns NAN.

        Having current point XC, this function scans active constraints,   detects
        ones  which  should  be deactivated by step in the antigradient direction,
        deactivates them, and returns constraints count.

        For example, if we have:
          XC=1.0,
          antigradient is equal to [-2]
          x>=0, x<=1
        then this function will detect that constraint "x<=1" will be  deactivated
        by  attempt  to  make  step  in the antigradient direction. Only presently
        active constraints are counted and deactivated.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   MinQP state.
            XC      -   current point, must be feasible with respect to all
                        constrants
            Buf     -   temporary buffer, automatically resized if needed

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   this function changes following fields of State:
                        * State.ActiveB     
                        * State.ActiveLin   
                        * State.ActiveLinCnt
                        * State.ActiveCM
                        * State.ActiveCR
            
        RESULT:

        Number of constraints being deactivated.

        NOTES:
            this function uses fields of State which are marked as
            "DropConstraints temporaries". These fields are changed during algorithm
            operation.

                        IMPROVED LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT METHOD FOR
                         NON-LINEAR LEAST SQUARES OPTIMIZATION

        DESCRIPTION:
        This function is used to find minimum of function which is represented  as
        sum of squares:
            F(x) = f[0]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1]) + ... + f[m-1]^2(x[0],...,x[n-1])
        using value of function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[].


        REQUIREMENTS:
        This algorithm will request following information during its operation:

        * function vector f[] at given point X
        * function vector f[] and Jacobian of f[] (simultaneously) at given point

        There are several overloaded versions of  MinLMOptimize()  function  which
        correspond  to  different LM-like optimization algorithms provided by this
        unit. You should choose version which accepts fvec()  and jac() callbacks.
        First  one  is used to calculate f[] at given point, second one calculates
        f[] and Jacobian df[i]/dx[j].

        You can try to initialize MinLMState structure with VJ  function and  then
        use incorrect version  of  MinLMOptimize()  (for  example,  version  which
        works  with  general  form function and does not provide Jacobian), but it
        will  lead  to  exception  being  thrown  after first attempt to calculate
        Jacobian.


        USAGE:
        1. User initializes algorithm state with MinLMCreateVJ() call
        2. User tunes solver parameters with MinLMSetCond(),  MinLMSetStpMax() and
           other functions
        3. User calls MinLMOptimize() function which  takes algorithm  state   and
           callback functions.
        4. User calls MinLMResults() to get solution
        5. Optionally, user may call MinLMRestartFrom() to solve  another  problem
           with same N/M but another starting point and/or another function.
           MinLMRestartFrom() allows to reuse already initialized structure.


        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            N       -   dimension, N>1
                        * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                        * if not given, automatically determined from size of X
            M       -   number of functions f[i]
            X       -   initial solution, array[0..N-1]

        OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
            State   -   structure which stores algorithm state

        NOTES:
        1. you may tune stopping conditions with MinLMSetCond() function
        2. if target function contains exp() or other fast growing functions,  and
           optimization algorithm makes too large steps which leads  to  overflow,
           use MinLMSetStpMax() function to bound algorithm's steps.

        This function sets scaling coefficients for LM optimizer.

        ALGLIB optimizers use scaling matrices to test stopping  conditions  (step
        size and gradient are scaled before comparison with tolerances).  Scale of
        the I-th variable is a translation invariant measure of:
        a) "how large" the variable is
        b) how large the step should be to make significant changes in the function

        Generally, scale is NOT considered to be a form of preconditioner.  But LM
        optimizer is unique in that it uses scaling matrix both  in  the  stopping
        condition tests and as Marquardt damping factor.

        Proper scaling is very important for the algorithm performance. It is less
        important for the quality of results, but still has some influence (it  is
        easier  to  converge  when  variables  are  properly  scaled, so premature
        stopping is possible when very badly scalled variables are  combined  with
        relaxed stopping conditions).

          settings: about 3 iterations - when we have analytic Jacobian, up to 2*N
          iterations - when we use finite differences to calculate Jacobian.

        AccType=1 is recommended when Jacobian  calculation  cost  is  prohibitive

        NOTES:

        1. Depending on function used to create state  structure,  this  algorithm
           may accept Jacobian and/or Hessian and/or gradient.  According  to  the
           said above, there ase several versions of this function,  which  accept
           different sets of callbacks.

           This flexibility opens way to subtle errors - you may create state with
           MinLMCreateFGH() (optimization using Hessian), but call function  which
           does not accept Hessian. So when algorithm will request Hessian,  there
           will be no callback to call. In this case exception will be thrown.

           Be careful to avoid such errors because there is no way to find them at
           compile time - you can see them at runtime only.

        This  subroutine  turns  on  verification  of  the  user-supplied analytic
        gradient:
        * user calls this subroutine before optimization begins
        * MinLMOptimize() is called
        * prior to actual optimization, for  each  function Fi and each  component
          of parameters  being  optimized X[j] algorithm performs following steps:
          * two trial steps are made to X[j]-TestStep*S[j] and X[j]+TestStep*S[j],
            where X[j] is j-th parameter and S[j] is a scale of j-th parameter
          * if needed, steps are bounded with respect to constraints on X[]
          * Fi(X) is evaluated at these trial points
          * we perform one more evaluation in the middle point of the interval
          * we  build  cubic  model using function values and derivatives at trial
            points and we compare its prediction with actual value in  the  middle
            point
          * in case difference between prediction and actual value is higher  than
            some predetermined threshold, algorithm stops with completion code -7;
            Rep.VarIdx is set to index of the parameter with incorrect derivative,
            Rep.FuncIdx is set to index of the function.
        * after verification is over, algorithm proceeds to the actual optimization.

        NOTE 1: verification  needs  N (parameters count) Jacobian evaluations. It
                is  very  costly  and  you  should use it only for low dimensional
                problems,  when  you  want  to  be  sure  that  you've   correctly
                calculated  analytic  derivatives.  You should not  use  it in the
                production code  (unless  you  want  to check derivatives provided
                by some third party).

        NOTE 2: you  should  carefully  choose  TestStep. Value which is too large
                (so large that function behaviour is significantly non-cubic) will
                lead to false alarms. You may use  different  step  for  different
                parameters by means of setting scale with MinLMSetScale().

        NOTE 3: this function may lead to false positives. In case it reports that
                I-th  derivative was calculated incorrectly, you may decrease test
                step  and  try  one  more  time  - maybe your function changes too
                sharply  and  your  step  is  too  large for such rapidly chanding
                function.

        INPUT PARAMETERS:
            State       -   structure used to store algorithm state
            TestStep    -   verification step:
                            * TestStep=0 turns verification off
                            * TestStep>0 activates verification

        GI(x) is  a  gradient  vector  whose  components  associated  with  active
        constraints are zeroed. It  differs  from  bounded  anti-gradient  because
        components  of   GI(x)   are   zeroed  independently  of  sign(g[i]),  and
        anti-gradient's components are zeroed with respect to both constraint  and
        sign.

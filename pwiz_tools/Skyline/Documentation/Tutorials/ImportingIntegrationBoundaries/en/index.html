    <h1 class="document-title">Skyline Importing Integration Boundaries from Other Tools</h1>
    <p>
        An important step in SRM data processing, and to an even greater extent for chromatograms extracted from data independent mass spectra (MS1 in
        DDA or MS/MS in DIA), is selecting the correct time range over which to integrate chromatogram peak areas for a desired peptide. In data
        independent methods especially, which can involve interrogating thousands or even tens of thousands of peptides per file, it is increasingly
        important to do this peak selection with tools that produce well calibrated probabilities, rather than relying on manual inspection to detect
        errors. Development of better tools for fully-automated peptide chromatogram peak assignment is an active area of current research<sup>1,
            2</sup>. To assist in development, testing, and use of these tools, Skyline now supports the ability to import chromatogram peak
        boundaries (i.e. the start and end times used in peak area integration) determined by other tools (e.g. OpenSWATH or mProphet). This feature
        can be used to benchmark or visualize the performance of other tools, or simply to incorporate their results into a Skyline-based workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the Import Peak Boundary feature in Skyline, you must first prepare a text file containing a list of the peak boundaries to be imported
        and the data file and peptide corresponding to each. The first line of the file should contain column names, which Skyline uses to figure out
        which column is which. The columns can be in any order as long as they are correctly named, and extraneous columns are not a problem (Skyline
        simply ignores them). The table below shows the columns Skyline expects to see, as well as what each column means and the allowed names for
        each column. Some columns are required, while others are optional.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left : 16px;">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Column</b></td>
                <td><b>Acceptable Names</b></td>
                <td><b>Meaning</b></td>
                <td><b>Optional or Required?</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Starting Peak Time</td>
                <td>MinStartTime / leftWidth</td>
                <td>Time, in minutes or seconds, at which the start of the peak occurs.</td>
                <td>Required</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>File corresponding to this peak group. The file must match the name of the file imported into Skyline.</td>

                <td>ModifiedPeptideSequence / FullPeptideName</td>

                <td>PrecursorCharge / Charge</td>
                <td>For which precursor charge state should the peak boundaries be adjusted? If this column is not specified, all precursor charge
                    states of the peptide are adjusted.</td>
                <td>Optional</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Sample Identifier</td>
                <td>SampleName</td>
                <td>For specifying the sample, in the case where one Skyline “file” actually represents multiple injections and it is important to
                    distinguish them.</td>
                <td>Optional</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        Notice that in the table above, each column can be called by multiple names, any of which Skyline will accept. This is to allow the results of
        many different tools (which give their output columns different names) to be easily imported. The following is a typical text file for
        importing, and is based on a text file output by the OpenSWATH tool:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-peak-boundary-csv.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This text file is tab-separated, but Skyline will also accept space, comma, or (if European language settings are enabled) semicolon as a
        separator. Peak Boundary times are specified in seconds here, but can also be specified in minutes (Skyline is able to detect which units were
        used). The columns can be in any order, and additional (extraneous) columns will be ignored. As noted above, peptide modified sequences can be
        expressed in many different ways, so GSMAFVPK(UniMod:259), GSMAFVPK[+8.0], and GSMAFVPK[Label (K) 6] are all acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peak Boundary times of “#N/A” may also be entered; this will cause Skyline to remove peak information for that peptide.
    </p>
    <p>
        To import a text file specifying peak integration, simply do the following in Skyline:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Import</b> and click <b>Peak Boundaries</b></li>
        <li>Select the file you want to import in the directory tree, and click <b>Open</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A progress bar should appear, and when it is done, the document’s peak boundaries will be adjusted to match those specified in the file:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-1.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        At present, only peak boundaries exported from OpenSWATH or Skyline itself can be imported without any change to the file. Other tools
        currently require some re-formatting of the text file, although the Skyline team is working to make external import easier for all peak
        picking tools. If there is a peak picking tool you would like us to support, please contact the Skyline team.

    <p>
        This tutorial covers how to work with Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM also referred to as Multiple Reaction Monitoring - MRM) data acquired
        with transition lists that were not created with Skyline. It also introduces how Skyline can be used to work with quantitative experiments
        that employ matching isotope labeled internal standard peptides.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, you will work with data as it was published with the introduction of the tool MRMer<sup>1</sup>, and also the data from an
        inter-laboratory study by Addona and co-investigators<sup>2</sup>, hereafter referred to as Study 7, performed as part of the National Cancer
        Institute supported Clinical Proteomics Technology Assessment for Cancer (CPTAC). Study 7 immediately preceded the introduction of Skyline as
        the tool of choice for the large inter-laboratory studies of the CPTAC Verification Working Group. As such, its accumulated data files
        provided the perfect test suite for ensuring Skyline could support the types of experiments being carried out by the Verification Working
        Group.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if you lack transition lists created outside Skyline, however, you can still learn about the features Skyline offers for working with
        LC-MRM acquisitions that use stable isotope labeled peptides as internal standards for analyte quantification. If you seek extremely high
        confidence in your peak identifications and quantitative measurements, matching reference peptides and Skyline support for them can play a
        critical role in helping you achieve your goals.
    </p>
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        To start this tutorial, download the following ZIP file:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://skyline.ms/tutorials/ExistingQuant.zip">https://skyline.ms/tutorials/ExistingQuant.zip</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Extract the files in it to a folder on your computer, like:
    </p>
    <p>
        C:\Users\brendanx\Documents
    </p>
    <p>
        This will create a new folder:
    </p>
    <p>
        C:\Users\brendanx\Documents\ExistingQuant
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have been using Skyline prior to starting this tutorial, it is a good idea to revert Skyline to its default settings. To do so: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start Skyline.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Start Page</b>, click <b>Blank Document</b> which looks like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="../../shared/en/skyline-blank-document.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Default</b>. </li>
        <li>Click <b>No</b> on the form asking if you want to save the current settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The document settings in this instance of Skyline have now been reset to the default.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this tutorial covers a proteomics topic, you can choose the proteomics interface by doing the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="keep-next">
        <li>Click the user interface control in the upper right-hand corner of the Skyline window, and click <b>Proteomics interface</b> which looks like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="../../shared/en/proteomics-interface.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyline is operating in proteomics mode which is displayed by the protein icon <img src="../../shared/protein-icon.png" /> in the upper
        right-hand corner of the Skyline window.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before importing an existing transition list into this new document, you should give Skyline as much information as you have available about
        the experimental context for which the transition list was designed and in which your data was collected. You will do this by adjusting the
        settings values for the document before attempting to insert the transition list into it.
    </p>
    <h1>Preparing a Document to Accept a Transition List</h1>
    <p>
        This tutorial starts with a look at a data set provided with the MRM analysis software tool named MRMer<sup>1</sup>, pronounced murmur. MRMer
        was an early predecessor to Skyline for viewing and integrating MRM chromatograms, and the data set was originally downloaded from its web
        page in 2008. In the MRMer data set, all of the peptides are from yeast and have MS/MS spectra available in the spectral libraries provided by
        the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). This means it is fairly easy to give Skyline some very useful information about
        the peptides monitored in this experiment by specifying a spectral library and a background proteome. How to create your own spectral
        libraries and background proteome files is covered in detail in the <a href="http://skyline.ms/tutorial_method_edit_zh.url">Targeted Method
            Editing</a> tutorial. Here you will use existing files which have been reduced to the minimum information necessary to complete this
        tutorial, in the interest of keeping the ZIP file download as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set up the spectral library for the MRMer document, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Peptide Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the <b>Library</b> tab.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Edit List</b> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button in the <b>Edit Libraries</b> form.</li>
        <li>Enter “Yeast_mini” in the <b>Name</b> field of the <b>Edit Library</b> form.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Browse</b> button.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the MRMer subfolder under the ExistingQuant folder created earlier.</li>
        <li>Select the file “Yeast_MRMer_mini.blib” which contains only spectra for the yeast peptides used in this study.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Library</b> form.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Libraries</b> form.</li>
        <li>Check the new “Yeast_mini” library appears in the <b>Libraries</b> list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Peptide Settings</b> form should now look something like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-1.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        To set up the background proteome for the MRMer document now, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <b>Peptide Settings</b> form, click the <b>Digestion</b> tab.</li>
        <li>From the <b>Background proteome</b> dropdown list, choose <b>&lt;Add…&gt;</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter “Yeast_mini” in the <b>Name</b> field of the <b>Edit Background Proteome</b> form.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button. </li>
        <li>Navigate to the MRMer subfolder under the ExistingQuant folder created earlier.</li>
        <li>Select the file “Yeast_MRMer_mini.protdb”.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Background Proteome</b> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Peptide Settings</b> form should now look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-2.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, before you can insert the transition list from the MRMer experiment into the current document, you will need to define the isotope
        modifications for the peptides it contains. The MRMer experiment included light unlabeled peptides and matching heavy peptides with stable
        isotope labeled amino acid residues (SILAC) labeling for Lysine and Arginine. If you inserted the MRMer transition list without first
        specifying the correct isotope modifications, Skyline would fail to recognize the <i>m/z</i> values for the heavy peptides in the transition
        list.
    </p>
    <p>
        To specify the SILAC labeling in the Skyline document settings, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the <b>Modifications</b> tab.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Edit List</b> button beside the <b>Isotope modifications</b> list.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button in the <b>Edit Isotope Modifications</b> form.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Name</b> field of the <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form, enter “Label:13C(6)15N(2) (C-term K)”.</li>
        <li>From the <b>Amino Acid</b> dropdown list, choose “K”.</li>
        <li>From the <b>Terminus</b> dropdown list, choose “C”.</li>
        <li>Check the <b>13C</b> and <b>15N</b> checkboxes to tell Skyline to use <sup>13</sup>C for all carbon atoms and
            <sup>15</sup>N for all nitrogen atoms present in a Lysine molecule, for a total mass shift of 8 Daltons (6x <sup>13</sup>C + 2x
            <sup>15</sup>N).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form should now look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-3.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Add a second isotope modification by doing the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button on the <b>Edit Isotope Modifications</b> form.</li>
        <li>From the <b>Name</b> dropdown list of the <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form, choose “Label:13C(6)15N(4) (C-term
            R)”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <b>13C</b> and <b>15N</b> checkboxes are checked automatically to tell Skyline to use <sup>13</sup>C for all carbon
        atoms and <sup>15</sup>N for all nitrogen atoms present in an Arginine molecule, for a total mass shift of 10 Daltons (6x <sup>13</sup>C + 4x
        <sup>15</sup>N).
    </p>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form should now look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-4.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyline automatically calculates both the monoisotopic and average masses, approximately 8 Daltons for Lysine (K) and 10 Daltons for Arginine
        (R) that will result from using 13C and 15N in these amino acid residues.
    </p>
    <p>
        To finish preparing to insert the transition list from the MRMer publication into the current document, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Isotope Modifications</b> form.</li>
        <li>Check the check boxes in the <b>Isotope modifications</b> list for the “Label:13C(6)15N(2) (C-term K)” and
            <b>“</b>Label:13C(6)15N(4) (C-term R)<b>”</b> modifications you just created.</li>
        <li>Also make sure the checkbox in the <b>Structural modifications</b> list for “Carbamidomethyl (C)” is checked, as it should be
            because you chose the default settings.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Peptide Settings</b> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You should see an empty spectrum chart appear on the right side of the Skyline Window. You are now ready to insert the MRMer transition list.
    </p>
    <h1>Inserting a Transition List with Associated Proteins</h1>
    <p>
        There are two ways you can insert a transition list into Skyline:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Insert into the form displayed by clicking the <b>Edit</b> menu, <b>Insert</b>, and then <b>Transition
                List</b>.</li>
        <li>Insert directly into the document by clicking the <b>Edit</b> menu, and then <b>Paste</b> (Ctrl-V).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For the MRMer data set, you will use the first method. For the Study 7 data set, you will use the second method. The first method, using the
        <b>Insert</b> form, has the benefit of automatically associating peptides with the proteins that contain them, if your document
        includes a background proteome. Currently this only works for peptides that appear in a single protein in the background proteome, but future
        versions of Skyline will offer some choice of how to handle peptides appearing in multiple proteins. For this tutorial, the two peptides from
        the MRMer transition list that appear in multiple proteins have been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add the transition list peptides to your current document, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Microsoft Excel to open the file “silac_1_to_4.xls” in the MRMer subfolder under the ExistingQuant folder created for this tutorial.
            This Excel file was created from the original “silac_1_to_4.transition.tsv” (tab separated value) file, from the MRMer download, for an
            experiment involving a 1 to 4, light to heavy, ratio mix.</li>
        <li>Make sure the page in the spreadsheet labeled “Fixed” on the left side of the horizontal scrollbar is active.</li>
        <li>Select the cells in the first 3 columns – peptide sequence (column A), precursor ion <i>m/z</i> (column B), product/fragment ion
            <i>m/z</i> (column C) <i>–</i> for all 296 rows.</li>
        <li>Copy the cells (Ctrl-C).</li>
        <li>Switch back to Skyline.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Insert</b>, and click <b>Transition List</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Insert Transition List</b> form appears:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-5.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Press Ctrl-V to paste the copied cells into the <b>Insert Transition List</b> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This will bring up the <b>Import Transition List: Identify Columns</b> form, which should look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-6.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the <b>Associate Proteins</b> checkbox is ticked.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This tells Skyline to create the Protein Name column by matching the peptide sequences to proteins found in the background proteome file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that even though the data you copied did not have column headers, Skyline was able to infer the identities of the peptide sequence,
        precursor <i>m/z</i> and product <i>m/z</i> columns. If you wanted to change those column identifications for some reason, each column has
        a drop-down list provided for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        To insert these peptides into the Skyline document:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
        <li>Press the Home key to scroll to the top of the new list of targets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The main Skyline window should show a number of peptides grouped within their proteins. The peptide icons should contain 3 vertical lines and a
        baseline (<img src="../../shared/peptide-icon.png" />), like a very small MS/MS spectrum, in the lower right corner (<img src="../../shared/peptide-with-spectrum-lines-icon.png" />). The presence of
        this image indicates the peptide has an associated MS/MS library spectrum. The peptide label should highlight in blue the C-terminal Lysine or
        Arginine, indicating the stable isotope labeled amino acid in the heavy, labeled form:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-7.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also see at the bottom right corner of the window, in the status bar, the indicator “1/296 tran”, confirming that all 296 transitions
        from the MRMer transition list were added to the document. To the left, also in the status bar, you can see that the document contains 24
        proteins, 44 peptides and 88 precursors, or 2 precursors per peptide.
    </p>
    <p>
        To have a closer look at the precursors and transitions in the document, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Expand All</b>, and click <b>Precursors</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note: To see more of the <b>Library Match</b> graph: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click and drag the light gray bar between the view and the dark gray rectangle in the center. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Take some time to select individual peptides and transitions in the peptide view. Review the transitions, and how their product ion peaks are
        ranked by intensity in the MS/MS library spectra. As you change selection in the peptide tree view, the MS/MS spectrum chart will update to
        show the spectrum that matches the current peptide, and the peak matching the selected transition will be highlighted in red:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-8.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        You will notice that not all of the peptides have the most abundant product ions chosen for transitions, like the one shown in the image above,
        and not all of the spectra look as well matched either.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not see the b-ions or the doubly charged fragment ions highlighted, you can have Skyline display them by making the following menu
        selections:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Ion Types</b> and click <b>B</b>.</li>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Charges</b> and click <b>2</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may have noticed that Skyline shows the same spectrum for both the light and heavy precursors. This spectral library may contain only
        spectra for the light precursor, but even if the library contains matches for both light and heavy, Skyline will use only one (by default the
        standard) to avoid having to worry about different intensity rankings between two MS/MS spectra. If the library contains only the spectrum
        matching the heavy, labeled form of the peptide, then Skyline will use that spectrum to rank transitions for both light and heavy precursors.
    </p>
    <h1>Importing Data</h1>
    <p>
        Of course, the most interesting reason to create a Skyline document like this from an existing transition list is to use Skyline to examine
        data collected on a triple quadrupole MS instrument using the original transition list.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Note: Since this tutorial was first written it has become common to create extended transition lists, sometimes called Assay
                Libraries, which can also be imported into Skyline in much the same way for use in analyzing data independent acquisition (DIA) runs.
                This method is covered elsewhere.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        To import the data supplied with the MRMer publication into the document you have created, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Save As</b>.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the MRMer subfolder under the ExistingQuant folder created earlier.</li>
        <li>In the <b>File name</b> field, enter “MRMer”.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button.</li>
        <li>On the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Import</b> and click <b>Results</b>.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Import Results</b> form.</li>
        <li>Select the “silac_1_to_4.mzXML” file in the file list. The original raw file (not available), from a Waters Quattro Premier, was converted
            to mzXML, because MRMer lacked the ability to read instrument native data file formats.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Skyline begins importing the file into its high-performance data file, where it will require much less disk space, and from which Skyline can
        retrieve the information it needs very quickly. Progress is displayed in a graph and in the status bar at the bottom of the Skyline window.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the import completes, transitions that have measured signal between the integration boundaries, displayed as dashed black lines, will have
        green dots added to the left of the transition icon. Transitions without a peak that can be included in the chosen peak group show a red dot.
        Precursors and peptides containing transitions with only green circles also show green dots. This is very nice data. You will see mostly green
        dots.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see a transition with a red dot, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click <b>Find</b> (Ctrl-F).</li>
        <li>Enter “ETFP” in the <b>Find what</b> field.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Find Next</b> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This should leave Skyline looking something like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-9.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also change the proportions allocated to the various panes by clicking and dragging the light gray splitter bars between them.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the chromatogram view is not as zoomed in as it appears in the image above, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Auto-Zoom</b> and click <b>Best Peak</b> (F11).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To gain a better understanding of why the y3 ion for this peptide is not included in the chosen peak group: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the “y3<b>”</b> ion under the “602.8266++” precursor. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This should change Skyline to look like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-10.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not see chromatograms for all three transitions, as shown above, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Transitions</b> and click <b>All</b> (shift-F10).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Now you can see that both y3 and y4 appear to have some interference causing them to display two peaks without complete separation. These are
        clearly not caused by the same peptide, because they are not present for y7, and relative intensities between the two transitions differ
        between the two peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you were still in the process of refining this method, you might try measuring y5 and y8 next time, as the MS/MS library spectrum indicates
        they might be measurable. If, however, you really want at least an initial measurement from this data, you have two options:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the transitions affected by interference from peak area calculations.</li>
        <li>Adjust the peak boundaries to exclude the interfering region.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        At the MacCoss lab we favor the first option, as the second will introduce unknown variance based on human judgment of the boundary of the
        interference, which is not really known. In this tutorial, however, you will try both options. To give more space to the chromatogram plot, do
        the following before starting the next section:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the pushpin <img src="../../shared/pushpin-icon.png" /> to the left of the X in the upper right corner of the <b>Library Match</b> title
            bar.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Removing a Transition Peak with Interference</h2>
    <p>
        Fortunately, it is now possible to simply mark transitions as not quantitative without removing them entirely. This removes them from total
        peak area calculations. To remove the y3 and y4 transitions from the light peak group, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click y4 in the <b>Targets</b> view.</li>
        <li>Ctrl-click y3 in the <b>Targets</b> view so that both are selected.</li>
        <li>In the heavy precursor, Ctrl-click y3 and y4 so that all 4 transitions are selected.</li>
        <li>Right-click the selection in the <b>Targets</b> view, and click <b>Quantitative</b> on the menu to uncheck it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the <b>Targets</b> view, you should see the y4 text “(ratio 0.37)” and y3 text “(ratio 0.59)” disappear from the end of the light
        transitions, and the precursor ratio “(total ratio 0.31)” change to “(total ratio 0.24)”. The text for the non-quantitative transitions also
        turned gray and in the chromatogram view, the lines for y4 and y3 became dashed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The precursor total area ratio is a weighted mean, using the internal standard peak area as the weights, which simplifies algebraically to:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-precursor-total-area-ratio-formula.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Removing either a light or heavy peak removes the peak for its matching transition. Hence, when only one pair of transitions remain, as with y7
        in this case, the ratio between the light and heavy peaks of that transition (here 0.24) will also be the total area ratio for the precursor.
    </p>
    <h2>Adjusting Peak Boundaries to Exclude Interference</h2>
    <p>
        To adjust the peak integration boundaries in an attempt to remove interference from the quantitative measurements, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click <b>Undo</b> (Ctrl-Z), to undo the quantitative property change you just made.</li>
        <li>Select the peptide element “K.ETFPILVEE<b><span class="blue">K</span></b>.Q [196, 205]”.</li>
        <li>Click the mouse below the x-axis just right of where the light (red) chromatogram reaches a minimum between the desired peak and the
            interference peak (about 29.8 minutes), and drag to where the heavy (blue) encounters a second peak at its right edge (about 30.4
            minutes).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This should leave Skyline showing something like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-11.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case, y4 and y3 show ratios of 0.31 and 0.35 respectively and y7 shows 0.23, yielding a weighted mean, precursor total ratio of 0.27.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two total ratio values 0.24 and 0.27 produced by the two different techniques of dealing with interference are both very close to the true
        ratio of 0.25 for this 1 to 4 (light to heavy) SILAC mix. The ratios of the peaks that showed interference (y3 and y4 for the EFP peptide),
        however, are closer to 1:3 than 1:4, calling into question how well this manual adjustment technique is actually working, and highlighting the
        reason we prefer removing such transitions entirely from quantitative calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further inspection of the data in this document will show you that most of the ratios for these peptides are extremely close to the expected
        value of 0.25. Also where a precursor has 3 or more transitions, Skyline displays a dot-product (dotp) value between the peak areas and the
        matching MS/MS peak intensities. Most of these are quite close to 1.0, for an exact match. You will also see a ratio dot-product (rdotp)
        calculated between the peak areas of the light and heavy standard peaks, with most values showing either 1 or very close to it, indicating
        highly similar relative intensities between light and heavy transition peak areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, before moving on to the second document in this tutorial, you many notice that 2 peptides (K.YVDPNVLPETESLALVID<b><span class="blue">R</span></b>.L and K.FPEPGYLEGV<b><span
                class="blue">K</span></b>.T) have transitions with only blank space where the others have green or red circles. This means the
        mzXML file you imported contained no data for these transitions. You can open the mzXML file in a text editor and search for the precursor
        <i>m/z</i> values to verify yourself that the precursors lack the transitions indicated by the original transition list. These types of
        anomalies are fairly typical of working with transition lists created either manually or by tools receiving less use and testing than Skyline.
    </p>
    <h1>Preparing a Document for CPTAC Study 7</h1>
    <p>
        In this next section, you will be working with the inter-laboratory CPTAC Study 7<sup>2</sup>, completed by the Verification Working Group
        before even the initial release of Skyline version 0.1 in 2008. Methods were created using spreadsheets and the resulting mass spectrometer
        data was analyzed using vendor-specific software.
    </p>
    <h1>Preparing a Document to Accept the Study 7 Transition List</h1>
    <p>
        Again the first task is to create a Skyline document from an existing transition list. The first step in inserting any transition list into
        Skyline is examining the transition list to understand what settings Skyline will require to recognize the <i>m/z</i> values in the list. To
        begin this examination:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Microsoft Excel to open the file “Study7 transition list.xls” in the Study 7 subfolder of the ExistingQuant folder you created for
            this tutorial.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        You should be presented with a spreadsheet that looks something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-transition-list-spreadsheet.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        You can tell that this is a spreadsheet created manually by someone who put significant effort, using borders, merged cells and highlighting,
        into making this set of transitions intelligible to other people, a job which Skyline now handles automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each peptide in this list has a light and heavy form. In the “Signature Peptide” column for each heavy peptide a single stable isotope labeled
        amino acid residue is highlighted in red. Scroll down through the entire list, and you will see that there are 4 labeling schemes:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>6 peptides have C-terminal Lysine labeled, with an 8 Dalton increase.</li>
        <li>2 peptides have C-terminal Arginine labeled, with a 6 Dalton increase.</li>
        <li>2 peptides have an internal Valine labeled, with a 5 Dalton increase.</li>
        <li>1 peptide has an internal Leucine labeled, with a 6 Dalton increase.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This labeling scheme is impossible to represent with only global modifications, like the ones used for the MRMer document, because some of the
        Lysine and Arginine labeled peptides also contain internal Valines and Leucines. The simplest strategy for dealing with this is to use global
        modifications for C-terminal Lysine and Arginine again, as you did for the MRMer document, and then apply the Valine and Leucine modifications
        manually.
    </p>
    <p>
        To prepare a new document with appropriate modifications for the Study 7 transition list, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the Skyline toolbar, click the <b>Save</b> button to save changes to the MRMer document.</li>
        <li>On the Skyline toolbar, click the <b>New Document</b> button on the far left.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Peptide Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Modifications</b> tab (if necessary).</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Edit List</b> button beside the <b>Isotope modifications</b> list.</li>
        <li>Select the “Label:13C(6)15N(4) (C-term R)” modification, so that your new modification will be added below it.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button on the <b>Edit Isotope Modifications</b> form.</li>
        <li>Choose “Label:13C(6) (C-term R)” from the <b>Name</b> dropdown list of the <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <b>13C</b> checkbox is automatically checked, to tell Skyline to use <sup>13</sup>C for all carbon atoms present in an Arginine
        molecule, for a total mass shift of 6 Daltons (6x <sup>13</sup>C).
    </p>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form should now look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-12.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        To finish preparing the document for the Study 7 transition list, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Edit Isotope Modifications</b> form.</li>
        <li>Check the “Label:13C(6) (C-term R)” modification you just created.</li>
        <li>Uncheck the “Label:13C(6)15N(4) (C-term R)” modification created for the MRMer document, if not unchecked.</li>
        <li>Make sure the checkbox for the <b>“</b>Label:13C(6)15N(2) (C-term K)” modification created for the MRMer document is still
            checked.</li>
        <li>Make sure the checkbox in the <b>Structural modifications</b> list for <b>“</b>Carbamidomethyl (C)<b>”</b>
            is still checked.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Library</b> tab.</li>
        <li>Uncheck the “Yeast_mini” library used in the MRMer document, if not unchecked.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Digestion</b> tab.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Background proteome</b> dropdown list, change to “None” from “Yeast_mini”.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button in the <b>Peptide Settings</b> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pasting a Transition List into the Document </h2>
    <p>
        To begin the work of adding targets to Skyline:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Switch back to Excel.</li>
        <li>Click on the “Raw” spreadsheet tab in line with the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        On this page, you will see the raw transition list, with 66 transitions, that was imported into the 4000 QTRAP instruments used in the study.
        However, you should remember that Skyline still lacks the information in its settings to handle the heavy transitions for the Valine and
        Leucine labeled peptides. To rectify this: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the “Simple” spreadsheet tab in line with the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Excel will present a version of the same data found in the “Raw” tab with the 9 transitions removed for the 3 heavy precursors with labeled
        Valine and Leucine. To add the remaining 57 transitions to your new Skyline document, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select all 6 columns and 57 rows on the “Simple” page of the Study 7 spreadsheet.</li>
        <li>Copy the cells (Ctrl-C).</li>
        <li>Switch back to Skyline.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click <b>Paste</b> (Ctrl-V).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This will bring up the <b>Import Transition List: Identify Columns</b> form, which should look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-13.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        Skyline should present the following error message:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-14.png" /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Messages like this are not uncommon when working with transition lists created outside Skyline. Others are presented in the Skyline
        instructional video on this subject (<a
            href="https://skyline.ms/wiki/home/software/Skyline/page.view?name=video_0-5b">Video 3: Existing Experiments</a>). Some
        of the most common reasons for seeing an error of this type are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Forgetting to specify a necessary modification</li>
        <li>Errors in the <i>m/z</i> values created manually or by other tools</li>
        <li>Including <i>m/z</i> values outside the bounds of the current instrument settings</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This last potential cause is the case for the current transition list, and you can see the message directs you to the
        <b>Instrument</b> tab in the <b>Transition Settings</b> form.
    </p>
    <p>
        To correct this issue, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>Cancel</b> button in the error message.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Transition Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Instrument</b> tab.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Max m/z</b> field, enter “1800”.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click <b>Paste</b> (Ctrl-V) again.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Collapse All</b> and click <b>Peptides</b> (Ctrl-shift-D).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This should leave the Skyline peptide view looking like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-15.png" />
    </p>
    <h2>Adjusting Modifications Manually</h2>
    <p>
        Eight peptides display bold, blue C-terminal K or R, but the other 3 lack a labeled amino acid. Those are the ones that need V or L explicitly
        labeled, because these modifications cannot be achieved through the <b>Peptide Settings</b> - <b>Modifications</b> tab.
    </p>
    <p>
        To specify an isotope modification on the V in the first peptide, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the “AGL<b><u>C</u></b>QTFVYGG<b><u>C</u></b>R” peptide.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click <b>Modify Peptide</b>.</li>
        <li>Select the blank entry from the <b>Isotope heavy</b> dropdown list for the “Label: 13C(6)N15(4) C-term R” to remove the stable
            isotope label from this C-terminal Arginine.</li>
        <li>Select <b>&lt;Add…&gt;</b> from the <b>Isotope heavy</b> dropdown list for the V residue in this
            peptide.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Name</b> dropdown list of the <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form, choose <b>“</b>Label:13C”.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Edit Isotope Modification</b> form should look like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-16.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This modification will apply a varying mass shift to any amino acid, depending on how many Carbon atoms it contains.
    </p>
    <ul class="keep-next">
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to return to the <b>Edit Modifications</b> form, which should now look like:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="s-17.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Edit Modifications</b> form to return to the document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Valine in the selected peptide will not yet be bold, because the peptide still does not contain a heavy precursor. To add the heavy
        precursor now, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hover the mouse over the peptide, and click the drop arrow that appears to its right.</li>
        <li>Check the <b>”</b>747.3481++ (heavy)<b>”</b> checkbox in the pick list that appears.</li>
        <li>Click the green check button in the top left corner (or press Enter).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The peptide view should now look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-18.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Now expand both the “744.8398++” precursor and the <b>“</b>747.3481++ (heavy)” precursor: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the “+” symbol to the left of the light and heavy precursor ion names. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Verify that the ions contain matching transitions, and they differ by 5 Daltons, as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create labeled precursors for the two remaining peptides, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click on the peptide “IVGGWE<b><u>C</u></b>EK”, and click <b>Modifiy</b>.</li>
        <li>Select the blank entry from the <b>Isotope heavy</b> dropdown list for the “Label: 13C96)15N(2)(C-term K)” to remove the stable
            isotope label from this C-terminal Lysine.</li>
        <li>Select the “Label:13C” modification from the <b>Isotope heavy</b> dropdown list for the V residue in this peptide.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
        <li>Hover the mouse over the peptide, and click the drop arrow that appears to its right.</li>
        <li>Check the “541.7637++ (heavy)” checkbox in the pick list that appears.</li>
        <li>Click the green check button (or press Enter).</li>
        <li>Right-click on the peptide “YEVQGEVFTKPQLWP”, and click <b>Modify</b>.</li>
        <li>Select the “Label:13C” modification from the <b>Isotope heavy</b> dropdown list for the L residue in this peptide.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
        <li>Hover the mouse over the peptide, and click the drop arrow that appears to its right.</li>
        <li>Check the “913.9746++ (heavy)” checkbox in the pick list that appears.</li>
        <li>Click the green check button (or press Enter).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You now have a Skyline document that accurately reflects the information in the original Study 7 transition list. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Save this document to “Study 7.sky” in the Study 7 subfolder of the ExistingQuant folder.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Importing Data from a Multiple Sample WIFF File</h2>
    <p>
        Thanks to the support of five major triple quadrupole vendors (Agilent, SCIEX, Shimadzu, Thermo, and Waters), Skyline now installs with full
        support for importing all of their formats without requiring any conversion. This means you can import data into this document from one of the
        sites that used a SCIEX 4000 QTRAP to measure these transitions by performing the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Import</b> and click <b>Results</b>.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button on the <b>Import Results</b> form to import single-injection replicates.</li>
        <li>Select the file “CPTAC_7_3_080829.wiff” in the Study 7 folder.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button in the <b>Import Results Files</b> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        Skyline may take a second or two to read the list of sample names in this multiple sample WIFF file, but then it should
        present you with a form that looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-19.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        For this tutorial, to reduce the time that will be required to complete the import:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uncheck the entries containing the text “Blank” (1 sample), “QC” (4 samples) and “gradientwash” (4 samples).</li>
        <li>Uncheck the “A2” (4 samples) and “A3” (4 samples) entries at the end also.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        Skyline should present the following message to allow you to remove the repeated prefix “7_3_” from all of the names it will
        use to display information about these replicates:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-20.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>Remove</b> button to accept this operation.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Skyline will begin importing the data from this WIFF file into its high-performance data file (Study 7.skyd), where it can be accessed much
        faster, and where all imported data for a document is compressed into a single file for easy sharing.
    </p>
    <h2>Inspecting and Adjusting Peak Integration</h2>
    <p>
        While Skyline is importing the raw data, which may take several minutes to complete (though it takes only 11 seconds on a modern 4-core i7
        processor), you can begin rearranging the graph views for optimal viewing. To show and reposition the peak area and retention time replicate
        comparison views, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Retention Times</b> and click <b>Replicate Comparison</b> (F8).</li>
        <li>Click and drag the window to the bottom edge of the Skyline window to dock it there.</li>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Peak Areas</b> and click <b>Replicate Comparison</b> (F7).</li>
        <li>Click and drag the window to the right edge of the Skyline window to dock it there.</li>
        <li>Adjust the view proportions to look something like the image below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="s-21.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        The currently selected peptide “YEVQGEVFTKPQ<b><span class="blue">L</span></b>WP”, which was the peptide at the C-terminal end of CRP
        protein, was actually somewhat problematic for the Verification Working Group in Study 7. As the data is imported, you can see that Skyline
        still sometimes fails to integrate the peaks across its replicates consistently. Several retention time outliers remain, and even some of the
        closer peaks over 25 minutes do not appear to be the same peptide, as the majority integrated at about 24.7 minutes. One clear problem is that
        the heavy, spiked in form is never very intense relative to the light, endogenous form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you can hover over the bars in either of the replicate charts until a hand cursor appears, and then click to navigate to the
        chromatogram for the corresponding replicate. You could use this to navigate to the chromatogram for each likely misidentified peak, and
        correct it using the same technique you used in the MRMer document, clicking and dragging below the x-axis, but for this tutorial, you can
        just delete this peptide, as the Verification Working Group did for their subsequent experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see that Skyline has done a much better job of integrating the rest of the peptides in this document. With a dataset containing only
        10 peptides, however, we highly recommend carefully reviewing each peptide and applying manual adjustment where something is obviously
        incorrect.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, in the image above, you can see that the precursor “541.7637++ (heavy)” for the peptide “I<b><span
                class="blue">V</span></b>GGWE<b><u>C</u></b>EK” appears to be missing data. This is because the transition list
        supplied to the mass spectrometer only specified one decimal place for precursor <i>m/z</i>, and it was rounded incorrectly to “541.7”. You
        can check this on the “Raw” tab in the Excel spreadsheet.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the correctly calculated precursor in this document to match up with the measured data, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Transition Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Method match tolerance</b> <b>m/z</b> field of the <b>Instrument</b> tab, enter “0.065”.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This should cause a green circle to appear beside the “541.7637++ (heavy)” precursor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another integration issue is that many elements in the peptide view display orange and red circles, indicating transitions with no integrated
        peak area. This is quite useful during certain phases of method refinement, as discussed in the <a
            href="https://skyline.ms/tutorial_method_refine_zh.url">Targeted Method Refinement</a> tutorial, but for a highly refined method like this,
        it is usually not providing relevant information. For this reason, there is an option to integrate peak areas for all transitions between the
        boundaries of the most intense peak and change the red dot indicator to show only when the area for a transition is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        To turn this on now, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Integrate All</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Note: This setting no longer impacts quantitative calculations as it did until Skyline 4.2. It now only impacts the colored dots in
                the Targets view and the “Peak Found Ratio” field in Skyline reports.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="keep-next">
        Skyline should now look something like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-22.png" />
    </p>
    <h2>Data Inspection with Peak Areas View</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Peak Areas</b> view in the image above gives you a pretty clear idea of what the Study 7 experiment was. It was a calibration
        curve with each concentration measured in technical quadruplicate. You can see that the heavy isotope labeled internal standard was injected
        at a constant concentration, but that over 50+ injections its peak area is degrading slightly. Although in the <b>Retention
            Times</b> view, you can see the peptide retention time was extremely stable, perfect for use in scheduled runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, you will focus on the <b>Peak Areas</b> view and the many options it provides for inspecting multiple replicate data
        sets. To give the <b>Peak Areas</b> view more room on your screen:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Double-click in the title bar labeled <b>Peak Areas</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <b>Peak Areas</b> view should pop out of the main Skyline window and float above it. Reposition it out of the way of the
        <b>Targets</b> view.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get started:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select each of the 10 remaining peptides in this document. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You will see that the first peptide and the last 5 peptides present peak area charts similar to the one in the image above, while the 4
        peptides between these appear much less precise.
    </p>
    <p>
        One important reason for co-injecting the stable isotope labeled reference peptides is that they can be used to normalize the peak areas of the
        endogenous unlabeled peptides, which should remove some of the run-to-run variability in those measurements. To see this visually in the
        <b>Peak Areas</b> view, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click in the <b>Peak Areas</b> graph, choose <b>Normalize To</b> and click <b>Heavy</b>.</li>
        <li>Review again the 6 peptides that appeared well behaved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        You should now see a normalized chart like the one below with the peptide SSDLVALSGGHTFG<b><span
                class="blue">K</span></b> selected:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-23.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see that, indeed, precision among the replicates for each concentration appears to have improved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Review the other 4 peptides, and you will see that they still do not display the expected pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another interesting way of looking at this normalization is by each transition separately. In a well behaved peptide, the ratio of each light
        transition to its heavy counterpart should be relatively similar. To review the ratios of the transitions separately, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Expand All</b> and click <b>Peptides</b> (Ctrl-D).</li>
        <li>Select the light precursor for each peptide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        For the 6 well behaved peptides, you should see a chart like the one below, with the ESDTSYVSL<b><span class="blue">K</span></b> peptide light precursor 564.7746++ selected:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-24.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        As expected, the ratios are quite similar. The second and third peptides (INDISHTQSVSA<b><span class="blue">K</span></b> and
        LFTGHPETLE<b><span class="blue">K</span></b>) are not quite as clean, but no real problems in transition ratios stick out. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the fourth peptide (HGFLP<b><span class="blue">R</span></b>) light precursor 363.7059++.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This should cause the peak area graph to look like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-25.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This seems to indicate some interference in the transition for y3, since its ratio, at low concentrations, is so different from the others for
        this peptide.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Peak Areas</b> view provides another way of inspecting the relative intensities of the transitions within a precursor. You can
        use it now to take another look at the HGFLP<b><span class="blue">R</span></b> peptide, by doing the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click the <b>Peak Areas</b> chart, choose <b>Normalize To</b> and click <b>Total</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The chart should change to something like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-26.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, this chart clearly indicates interference on the transition for y3 (brown) that becomes less of a factor as the concentration of the
        endogenous peptide increases, beyond the E replicates. If you move the peak area view to a location where you can also see the chromatogram
        charts, you can click on the individual bars to see the interfering peak, which, in this case, is pretty clear, as in replicate E_03 below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-27.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        As with the case in the MRMer document, you might attempt to adjust the integration boundaries to exclude the interfering peak, but it is
        probably a better idea to just delete the y3 transition altogether or make it non-quantitative, especially since it never provides a very
        large contribution to the total peak area for the peptide. To gain some insight into the precision of these measurements, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Peak Areas</b> and click <b>Peptide Comparison</b> (Ctrl-F7).</li>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Transitions</b> and click <b>Total</b> (Ctrl-F10).</li>
        <li>Right-click on the <b>Peak Areas</b> chart and click <b>CV Values</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Peak Areas</b> chart should have changed to look something like:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-28.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        If the peptides do not appear in this order, do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click on the <b>Peak Areas</b> chart, choose <b>Order</b> and click <b>Document</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Of course, for analyte precursors, shown in red, the coefficients of variance (CV) are very high and of no real interest, because the data set
        contains 10 different concentrations points for the analyte peptides. The CV values for the heavy precursors, however, shown in blue, are
        informative, since they were supposed to be injected into all samples at a constant concentration. Given what you have seen so far, it should
        not be surprising that the 6 peptides identified as clearly displaying the expected concentration changes also have CV values around 10% or
        lower, while the other 4 peptides have CV values closer to 40% or even %50.
    </p>
    <p>
        With just a few simple operations in Skyline, you have learned things about this data set that required weeks and the involvement of
        statisticians and programmers for the Verification Working Group to learn in the original study. If you have done the <a
            href="https://skyline.ms/tutorial_method_refine_zh.url">Targeted Method
            Refinement</a> tutorial, you may now be imagining why you would want to run a refinement cycle involving a scheduled multi-replicate data
        set to better understand how your targeted peptides respond in this setting before measuring them on high value samples.
    </p>
    <h2>Settings Concentration Values</h2>
    <p>
        It would be easier to interpret the data in the replicate graphs if the x-axis showed the concentration of the sample instead of the name of
        the replicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyline has extensive built-in support for calibration curves which you can learn more about in the <a
            href="https://skyline.ms/tutorial_absolute_quant_zh.url">Absolute Quantification</a> tutorial. For now, you will simply use the built-in
        <b>Analyte Concentration</b> annotation to give Skyline more information about the spiked in concentrations in these replicate runs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>Document Grid</b> can be used for this purpose. To show the <b>Analyte Concentration</b> report field do the
        following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, click <b>Document Grid</b> (Alt-3).</li>
        <li>On the <b>Reports</b> menu in the upper left corner of the <b>Document Grid</b>, click <b>Replicates</b>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <b>Document Grid</b> should now be showing you the <b>Replicate</b>, <b>Sample Type</b>, and <b>Analyte
            Concentration</b> fields in 40 rows, one for each sample. The concentrations at which the samples were prepared were:

    <ul>
        <li>Use the above table to fill in the <b>Analyte Concentration</b> field for each replicate.</li>
        <li>Set the <b>Sample Type</b> field to “Standard” for all replicates except the A replicates which can be set to “Blank”.</li>
        <li>Tip: Once you have entered the first value which needs to be repeated, you can:<ul>
                <li>Select it and the other cells you want to have the same value.</li>

        <img src="s-30.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This graph shows that the CVs are quite low until the very lowest concentrations. You can easily switch to a graph showing the mean ratios with
        whiskers showing the standard deviations by doing the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click the <b>Peak Areas</b> graph, click <b>CV Values</b> to uncheck the menu item.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        This should change the graph to look like:

    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Save</b>, to end this section. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
    <p>
        Eight different labs participated in Study 7, and each generated several data sets similar to the one you have been reviewing in this tutorial.
        Not all of them, however, experienced the same issues in the same ways. The data from a different site and a different sub-section of this
        study is also included with this tutorial. In this case, the document has already been created and the data set imported.
    </p>
    <p>
        To open the document with Study 7-II data from site 52, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Open</b> (Ctrl-O).</li>
        <li>Navigate to the Study II subfolder under the Study 7 subfolder of the ExistingQuant folder created at the beginning of this tutorial.</li>
        <li>Select the “Study 7ii (site 52).sky” file.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The file will open quickly, and you will see that the CV values for the injected isotope labeled standards are different,
        appearing as in the chart below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-32.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        The peptide INDISHTQSVSA<b><span class="blue">K</span></b> is the only one of the 4 from the first data set that still has a CV
        around 40%, while the peptide LSEPAELTDAV<b><span class="blue">K</span></b> now has a CV around 25%. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the peptide LSEPAELTDAV<b><span class="blue">K</span></b> in the <b>Targets</b> view.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you look at the <b>Retention Times: Replicate Comparison</b> graph, however, you will see that Skyline has chosen the wrong peaks
        for 3 of the “Blank” replicates (though this issue was fixed a long time ago – but after the document data was imported and saved):
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-33.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        If you correct these by clicking and dragging beneath the x-axis, the CV for the heavy precursor of LSEPAELTDAV<b><span
                class="blue">K</span></b> drops to around 10% with most of the other peptides.
    </p>
    <p>
        To review light:heavy ratios in this data set, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, choose <b>Peak Areas</b> and click <b>Replicate Comparison</b> (F7).</li>
        <li>Right-click on the <b>Peak Areas</b> graph, choose <b>Normalize To</b> and click <b>Heavy</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You will find that the charts for all peptides, even INDISHTQSVSA<b><span
                class="blue">K</span></b> look quite nice in this data set.
    </p>
    <ul class="keep-next">
        <li>Click the “INDISHTQSVSA<b><span class="blue">K</span></b>” peptide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="s-34.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This seems to indicate that the internal standard is doing its job of compensating for variance in measurements of this peptide. To review the
        un-normalized data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click on the <b>Peak Areas</b> chart, choose <b>Normalize To</b> and click <b>None</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        It would be hard to guess from this chart that the normalization would be so effective:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-35.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, returning to the peptide in which we detected interference in the first data set:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the light precursor “363.7059++” of the peptide HGFLP<b><span class="blue">R</span></b>.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the <b>Peak Areas</b> chart, choose <b>Transitions</b> and click <b>All</b>.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the <b>Peak Areas</b> chart, choose <b>Normalize To</b> and click <b>Heavy</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        Here also, you will see clear evidence of interference on the y3 transition:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-36.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the first data set, however, it is much harder to see the interference by inspecting the individual chromatograms. In this case, due to
        slightly different chromatography conditions, it is rarely possible to see evidence of two peaks in the integrated range for y3, as in
        replicate E_03 shown below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="s-37.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        The NCI CPTAC Study 7 provided quite a lot more data, all of which is now public. Skyline can help you learn a lot about this data quickly,
        even though the study was performed without its participants even knowing that Skyline would ever exist.
    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, you have learned how easy Skyline makes it to approach data from experiments designed and executed without any consideration
        for Skyline, whether those be your own experiments, before you started using Skyline, or experiments of others you wish to review or possibly
        repeat. For both the published data sets of MRMer and NCI CPTAC Study 7, you quickly created a Skyline document from transition lists, even
        when they contained relatively complicated modification schemes, including isotope labeled internal standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have also learned a bit about the features Skyline provides for working quantitative targeted proteomics experiments involving isotope
        labeled peptide precursors. From the ease with which isotope labeling modifications can be defined to the ease with which they can be
        assigned, Skyline simplifies the work of creating instrument methods for these experiments. From accurate light:heavy peak area ratios to
        powerful chart display options, Skyline gives you rich insight into data collected for these experiments.

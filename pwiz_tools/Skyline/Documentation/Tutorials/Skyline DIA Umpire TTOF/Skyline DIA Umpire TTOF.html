                <p>Note: This tutorial uses data from a Sciex TripleTOF 6600 instrument. If you prefer to use the data from a Thermo Q-Exactive Plus,
                    see the version of this tutorial entitled Skyline DIA QE. </p>

    </table>
    <p>In this tutorial you will learn how to use Skyline to perform targeted post-acquisition analysis for peptide and inferred protein detection and
        quantification using a SWATH-MS dataset acquired on a QqTOF instrument (6600 TripleTOF, Sciex) using a 64 variable width window precursor
        isolation scheme and a 1 hour gradient.</p>
    <p>The data are from samples replicating the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v34/n11/full/nbt.3685.html">LFQBench<em> </em>study</a>
        where quantitative benchmarking samples were created by mixing proteomes of 3 organisms in defined ratios (figure). </p>
    <p>Initially, you will set all the parameters in the Skyline session required to work with data-independent datasets and then you will proceed to
        extract the quantification information from the raw data files. You will tell Skyline to deconvolute the DIA spectra to pseudo-DDA spectra
        using the DIA-Umpire algorithm, then search those spectra with MSAmanda to create a spectral library in order to generate peptide query
        parameters to analyze the DIA data. No pre-existing spectral library is required for this data analysis method.</p>

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>To start this tutorial, download the following ZIP file:</p>
    <p><a href="https://skyline.ms/tutorials/DIA-TTOF.zip">https://skyline.ms/tutorials/DIA-TTOF.zip</a></p>
    <p>Extract the files in it to a folder on your computer, like:</p>
    <p>C:\Users\brendanx\Documents</p>
    <p>This will create a new folder:</p>
    <p>C:\Users\brendanx\Documents\DIA-TTOF</p>
    <p>If you have been using Skyline prior to starting this tutorial, it’s a good idea to revert Skyline to its default settings. To do so: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start Skyline.</li>
        <li>On the <strong>Start Page, </strong>click <strong>Blank Document </strong>which looks like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-2.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>Settings</strong> menu, click <strong>Default. </strong></li>
        <li>Click <strong>No </strong>on the form asking to save the current settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The settings in your current instance of Skyline have now been reset to the default. </p>
    <p>Since this tutorial covers a proteomics topic, ensure that the user interface is set to the “Proteomics interface” </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the user interface button in the upper right hand corner on the Skyline toolbar and select <strong>Proteomics Interface
            </strong>which looks like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-3.png" /></p>
    <p>Skyline is operating in Proteomics mode which is displayed by the protein icon <img src="image-4.png" /> in the upper right-hand corner of
        Skyline.</p>
    <p>For DIA analysis, you will want to force Skyline to integrate peak areas for all extracted quantitative transitions. To do that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>Settings</strong> menu, click <strong>Integrate all.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Using the Import Peptide Search wizard</h1>
    <p>If you know where to look, you could perform all of the following steps through various menu options on Skyline. To simplify the normal
        workflow for DIA, you will instead use a “wizard” which will step you through the critical choices required for Skyline to run the analysis.
        You will start by telling Skyline to deconvolute the DIA spectra to pseudo-DDA spectra using the DIA-Umpire algorithm, specifying various
        settings and the FASTA targets which you are interested in querying, searching the DDA spectra with MS Amanda, and finally building a spectral
        library from the DDA search results. Skyline will then automatically extract chromatograms from the original DIA files.</p>
    <p>To get started do the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Search</strong>, and click <strong>Run Peptide Search</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skyline tells you that you need to save the current document so that it will know where you want to perform the analysis on your computer disk
        drive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the DIA-TTOF folder created earlier.</li>
        <li>In the <strong>File name </strong>field, type “DIA-TTOF-tutorial”.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">The <strong>Run Peptide Search</strong> wizard should appear looking like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated" src="image-5.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Add Files</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the DIA-TTOF folder created earlier and into its DIA subfolder.</li>
        <li>Drag a selection box around the first 2 mzML files, “...001_SW-A” and “...002_SW-B”.</li>
        <li>In the <strong>iRT standard peptides</strong> dropdown list, click “Biognosys-11 (iRT-C18)”.</li>
        <li>In the <strong>Workflow</strong> box, click the <strong>DIA with DIA-Umpire</strong> option.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">The <strong>Spectral Library</strong> page of the wizard should now look like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated" src="image-6.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">The <strong>Import Results </strong>form should appear asking you how to handle the prefix and suffix shared by the two mzML
        files: </p>
    <p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email

Description automatically generated" src="image-7.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The wizard will advance to the <strong>Add Modifications</strong> page, where it lists all of the amino acid modifications in the document that
        you might want to include in the DDA search. It is important to distinguish here between fixed and variable modifications: fixed (sometimes
        called static) modifications are always applied to the specified amino acids. For example, Carbamidomethyl C is usually treated as a fixed
        modification because all cysteines in the data are expected to be alkylated. Oxidation M is almost always treated as a variable modification
        because oxidation is hit-or-miss depending on sample handling. Skyline’s search always treats isotopic labels as variable, but you can change
        whether other modifications are treated as fixed or variable by clicking on the <strong>Edit modifications</strong> button.</p>
    <p>You can also add modifications to the document from this page. Since this Skyline document was reset to defaults, the list starts with only
        Carbamidomethyl (C) and Oxidation (M):</p>
    <p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated" src="image-8.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the checkboxes for both modifications are checked.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The wizard will advance In the <strong>Configure Transition Settings</strong> page. Make the following changes from the default values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For <strong>Precursor charges</strong>, enter “2, 3, 4”.</li>
        <li>For <strong>Ion types</strong>, enter “y, b”.</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>NOTE: You could leave the ion type “p” which stands for precursor, and Skyline would extract chromatograms covering the precursor
                    isotope distribution from the MS1 spectra in the DIA data files. However, to simplify this tutorial and reduce processing time and
                    output file size, the description below deals only with fragment ion chromatograms extracted from the DIA MS/MS spectra.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="keep-next">The <strong>Import Peptide Search</strong> form should look like:</p>
    <p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated" src="image-9.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skyline presents the <strong>Configure Full-Scan Settings </strong>page. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> These extraction settings depend on the type and settings of the instrument used for data acquisition. The optimal
        extraction settings may be slightly different for each dataset. In this analysis you will use centroided data to save space. So you should
        select ‘Centroided’ and specify a ‘20’ ppm mass accuracy for extraction. With profile mode data the resolving power of the instrument can be
        specified.</p>
    <p>Make the following changes to the default values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>Mass accuracy</strong> field, use “20” ppm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now you need to define a new isolation scheme according to the parameters defined on the instrument for data-independent acquisition.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this example, we used 64 variable width windows that covered the range from 400 to 1200 m/z with 1 m/z overlap to
        support 0.5 m/z excluded margins at the edges of the quadrupole range.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>Isolation scheme</strong> dropdown list, click “&lt;Add…&gt;”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This brings up the <strong>Edit Isolation Scheme</strong> form in which you should do the following.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter “ETH TTOF (64 variable)”.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Prespecified isolation windows</strong> option.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Import</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the DIA-TTOF folder created earlier and into its DIA subfolder.</li>
        <li>Double-click the file “collinsb_I180316_001_SW-A.mzML”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Edit Isolation Scheme</strong> form should now look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="image-10.png" /></p>
    <p>Skyline has worked out the <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>End</strong> <em>m/z</em> values for the DIA isolation ranges measured on the
        mass spectrometer. You can see that they overlap by 1.0 <em>m/z</em> to compensate for the overlap, Skyline has added a 0.5 <em>m/z</em>
        margin to each side of the isolation windows, which it will exclude from consideration during chromatogram extraction. To see this in action:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the dropdown list beneath <strong>Prespecified isolation window</strong>, click “Extraction”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will see the <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>End</strong> values shift inward by 0.5 <em>m/z</em> and the ranges will no longer overlap.
        These are the ranges that Skyline will use when matching peptide precursor <em>m/z</em> values to acquired spectra for fragment ion
        chromatogram extraction.</p>
    <p>To visualize the isolation scheme:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Graph</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will see a form like the one below:</p>
    <p><img src="image-11.png" /></p>
    <p>You can click-and-drag a rectangle to zoom in or use the mouse scroll-wheel, and see the margins. If you uncheck and re-check <strong>Show
            margins</strong>, the graph title will switch between <strong>Measurement Windows</strong> and <strong>Extraction Windows</strong>, and
        the pink margin bars will disappear and re-appear. There is no red for <strong>Show gaps</strong> or yellow for <strong>Show single cycle
            overlaps</strong>, which are both errors DIA isolation scheme design.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Close</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>OK </strong>button in the <strong>Edit Isolation Scheme</strong> form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Import Peptide Search </strong>wizard should now look like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated" src="image-12.png" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">You will see the <strong>Import FASTA</strong> page, which should look like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button.</li>

        <li>Double-click on the “nodecoys_3mixed_human_yeast_ecoli_20140403_iRT.fasta” file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Import target proteins from a separate FASTA</strong> option tells Skyline that you want to import a (usually smaller) set of
        proteins as targets but run the MS Amanda search on a different FASTA (usually a full proteome). This is useful because doing a DDA search on
        a small FASTA introduces problems with estimating FDR.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>NOTE: At this point, you could choose to perform a proteome-wide analysis by instead navigating to the DDA_search subfolder and
                    double-clicking the full FASTA sequence file “nodecoys_3mixed_human_yeast_ecoli_20140403_iRT.fasta” that will be used in the
                    peptide search. This would produce quite a lot more targets and take more time to process, but is still feasible on most modern

        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The wizard will advance to the <strong>Adjust Search Settings</strong> page. Here you can set the most important parameters for the DDA search.
        For this tutorial, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>MS1 tolerance</strong> field, enter “5”. (Note that when you leave the text box the form will assume you mean ppm and set
            the unit box accordingly.)</li>
        <li>In the <strong>MS2 tolerance</strong> field, enter “10”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">The form should now look like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer

Description automatically generated" src="image-16.png" /></p>
    <p>The <strong>Max q-value</strong> field sets a false discovery rate (FDR) limit allowed for the peptide matches in the search results. In this
        tutorial, you will use a 5% FDR because this is a small dataset.</p>
    <p>Note: The field often uses a 1% FDR (maximum q value of 0.01) for searches like this.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>Max q-value</strong> field, enter “0.05”.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button to start the search.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">The <strong>DDA Search</strong> page will show you the progress of the DIA-Umpire deconvolution and MS Amanda search. You may

    <p>After the search is finished:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>Finish</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skyline should begin building the library, showing progress in a form titled <strong>Build Peptide Search Library</strong>. When the library
        build is complete will attempt to calibrate iRT values from the peptide search results based on the Biognosys iRT standards which were spiked
        into these samples. This should succeed and present a summary form like the one below:</p>
    <p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, table

    </ul>
    <p>Skyline will ask if you want to recalibrate the iRT standard values onto the regression line calculated and shown in the graph above.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>No</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skyline presents a long list of peptides with ambiguous matches. In other words, the only evidence for these peptides came from spectra which
        were matched to multiple peptides, making those spectra and matching peptides not ideal for subsequent targeted analysis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">You should be presented with a form describing the targets calculated based on your settings and the FASTA sequence text
        provided that looks like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email

Description automatically generated" src="image-20.png" /></p>
    <p>Notice that with a <strong>Min peptides per protein</strong> filter of “1” the 13 proteins found in the FASTA file produce 9
        <strong>Remaining</strong> proteins. This is because four proteins have no peptides which are found in the spectral library. If you click
        <strong>Keep all</strong>, you will see a warning “4 empty proteins will be added”, but switch back before continuing to avoid adding the
        empty proteins to your targets list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">Skyline begins extracting chromatograms:</p>
    <p><img alt="Graphical user interface

Description automatically generated" src="image-21.png" /></p>
    <p class="keep-next">After the import is completed, Skyline will show you the mProphet model you requested on the <strong>Import FASTA</strong>
        page of the <strong>Import Peptide Search</strong> wizard. It should look like this:</p>
    <p><img alt="Chart, histogram

Description automatically generated" src="image-22.png" /></p>
    <p>It has already been used to re-score the 10 best peaks Skyline found in each set of chromatograms, using its default score, and re-choose the
        peaks to be the ones with the best mProphet scores. These mProphet scores (given the name <strong>Detection Z Score</strong> in Skyline) are
        scaled such that 1.0 is 1 standard deviation from the mean mProphet score for the distribution of similar best peaks for the sequence shuffled
        decoy peptides you requested. Each has also been assigned a q value (given the name <strong>Detection Q Value</strong> in Skyline).</p>
    <h1>Inspect the data manually</h1>
    <p>Next you will manually inspect some of the chromatography and underlying spectra. To do that, you will want the <strong>Retention
            Times</strong> and <strong>Peak Areas</strong> views are showing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>View</strong> menu, choose <strong>Retention Times</strong>,<strong> </strong>and click <strong>Replicate
                Comparison</strong> (F8).</li>
        <li>On the<strong> View </strong>menu, choose <strong>Peak Areas</strong>, and click <strong>Replicate Comparison</strong> (F7). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now both views should be visible. You can configure them optimally on the screen by doing the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If these new windows are floating you can dock them to the main window by clicking on the top border of the floating window, holding the
            left mouse button down, and dragging this window. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can perform that same operations shown below with the <strong>Library Match</strong> window.</p>
    <p>Note: In order to dock a window like this, the mouse arrow cursor must be placed inside one of the docking icons, in this case, at the top.
        Once you begin dragging with the left-mouse button held down, Skyline will show the docking icons and a transparent blue rectangle where the
        window will be placed if you were to release the left-mouse button at that moment.</p>
    <p><img src="image-23.png" /><img src="image-24.png" /> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Similarly, dock the <strong>Peak Area: Replicate Comparison</strong> and <strong>Library Match</strong> windows so that all information is
            easily viewable, as below: </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img alt="Graphical user interface, application

    <ul>
        <li>Click on the first E. coli protein: “<a id="OLE_LINK1"></a><a id="OLE_LINK2"></a>sp|P63284|CLPB_ECOLI”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should see all of the peptides for this protein shown on the various plots (chromatogram, peak areas, and retention time replicate graphs).
        The screenshot above is an example of when one protein is selected and all of the peptides for this protein are summarized in each of these
        views (except library match window where nothing is shown).</p>
    <p>Based on what you see in the <strong>Peak Area - Replicate Comparison</strong> plot, does this protein appear to be differentially regulated?
        Recall that the expected fold-change ratio between A:B is 4:1 for E. coli.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the peptide <a id="OLE_LINK3"></a><a id="OLE_LINK4"></a>TDINQALNR in this protein.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You get specific information for this peptide in all of the views, as shown below:</p>
    <p><img alt="Graphical user interface

Description automatically generated" src="image-26.png" /></p>
    <p>Examine the peak area patterns for the rest of the peptides belonging to this protein. Is the quantitative pattern for the peptides from this
        protein consistent with the expected differential regulation pattern (4:1)?</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If there is more than one precursor charge state for a given peptide sequence these are extracted and scored separately.
        You can look at these by clicking the <strong>+</strong> next to the peptide sequence and clicking on the individual charge states.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on some of the human proteins in the document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examine the replicate peak areas from the protein level view and the peptide level view. Are the peak areas consistent with the expected ratio
        (1:1)? What about the yeast proteins (1:2)?</p>

    <h1>Mass error and retention time deviation </h1>
    <p>You can examine the mass accuracy and retention time prediction accuracy to determine whether the optimal extraction parameters have been used
        or whether some adjustment may improve the results.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>View</strong> menu, choose <strong>Mass Errors</strong>, and click <strong>Histogram</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will show the distribution of mass errors over the data set. Could the extraction window (±20 ppm) have been further optimized? Generally
        the mean error +/- 3 standard deviations is sufficient. If the histogram appears cut off, however, with high counts at the extremes then you
        may want to widen your extraction windows. </p>
    <p><img alt="Chart, histogram

Description automatically generated" src="image-30.png" /></p>
    <p>Note that the distribution appears to have two peaks, one around 0 and one around 5. To understand this better, it helps to know that these are
        the mass error values across all 6 runs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click the graph, choose <strong>Replicates</strong>, and click <strong>Single</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click in the <strong>Replicates</strong> dropdown list at the top of the <strong>Targets</strong> view.</li>
        <li>Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to review the mass error values in all 6 replicates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will see that the mean value ranges from -0.4 to 4.5, while the standard deviation value ranges from 3.7 to 4.5. Using the simple
        calculation Mean + 3 * SD = 4.5 + 4.5*3 = 18 PPM at the most extreme, this seems to indicate that a 20 PPM tolerance is a pretty good
        approximation of what these data require.</p>
    <p>To view the mass errors for the decoys also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click the graph, choose <strong>Points</strong>, and click <strong>Decoys</strong>.</li>
        <li>Right-click the graph, choose <strong>Replicates</strong>, and click <strong>All</strong>.<br />(and then switch back to
            <strong>Targets</strong>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To the see the linear regression used to predict the target peptide retention times based on the iRT peptides and library iRT values from the
        target peptides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>View </strong>menu, choose <strong>Retention Times</strong>, then <strong>Regression</strong>, and click <strong>Score to
                Run</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><a id="_Hlk23864603"></a><img alt="Chart, line chart

    <ul>
        <li>Right-click the graph, choose <strong>Plot</strong>,<strong> </strong>and click <strong>Residuals</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will show the deviations from the predicted retention times in this data set. Could the extraction window (± 5 minutes) have been further
        optimized for this analysis? Check the decoys as well.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The spectral library for this analysis was constructed from the DIA-Umpire pseudo-DDA spectra. As such, the accuracy of
        the retention time predictions are very good. Retention times from external spectral libraries acquired on different instruments, at different
        times, from different samples would lead to larger errors in these predictions.</p>
    <h1>Further Reading</h1>
    <p>At this point, this tutorial may be continued at another tutorial, <a
            href="https://skyline.ms/wiki/home/software/Skyline/page.view?name=tutorial_dia_swath">Analysis of DIA/SWATH Data</a>. If you have not
        viewed that tutorial before, we recommend that you do it now, starting at the <strong>Sample Annotation</strong> and <strong>Quantitative
            Comparison</strong> sections, to learn how to perform a quantitative analysis once some DIA data has been imported into Skyline.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Congratulations! You have completed your first analysis using Skyline’s DIA-Umpire implementation. You have learned how to use the
        <strong>Import Peptide Search</strong> wizard to seamlessly make a spectral library out of DIA data, extract quantitative chromatograms from
        them, and create and apply an mProphet statistical peak detection model to improve peak selection and assign q values which can be used to
        control the false discovery rate among the peak areas you used in your group comparison. You learned to first assess the DIA data quality with
        the mass error and retention time regression plots. </p>
    <p>Now consider retrying these steps with the proteome-wide FASTA file, using all 6 DIA files as input, and/or including precursor ions to see how
        this works with a broader target set and/or another dimension (precursor ions in MS1 spectra). Or move on to trying this with your own data.

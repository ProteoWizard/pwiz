    <p>
        The Skyline Targeted Mass Spectrometry Environment provides informative visual displays of the raw mass spectrometer data you import into your
        Skyline documents. Originally developed for proteomics use, Skyline has been extended to work with generalized molecules. There are many
        tutorials available that will help you use Skyline for various types of analysis (SRM, PRM, MS1 Filtering, DIA, etc). This tutorial
        concentrates on the differences in using Skyline for targeting non-proteomic molecules.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, you will build an SRM assay for a group of Methionine-pathway compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyline aims to provide a vendor-neutral platform for targeted quantitative mass spectrometry research. It can import raw data from the
        instrument vendors Agilent, Bruker, SCIEX, Shimadzu, Thermo-Scientific and Waters. The ability to import data across various instrument
        platforms greatly facilitates dissemination of reproducible methods, skill transfer across labs, cross-instrument comparisons and large
        multi-site studies. This remains equally true in using Skyline to target generalized molecules, as it has been for years in the field of
        proteomics.
    </p>
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        To start this tutorial, download the following ZIP file:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://skyline.ms/tutorials/SmallMolecule_3_6.zip">https://skyline.ms/tutorials/SmallMolecule_3_6.zip</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Extract the files in it to a folder on your computer, like:
    </p>
    <p>
        C:\Users\bspratt\Documents
    </p>
    <p>
        This will create a new folder:
    </p>
    <p>
        C:\Users\bspratt\Documents\SmallMolecule
    </p>
    <p>
        It will contain all the files necessary for this tutorial.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have been using Skyline prior to starting this tutorial, it is a good idea to revert Skyline to its default settings. To do so: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start Skyline.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Start Page</b>, click <b>Blank Document</b> which looks like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="../../shared/en/skyline-blank-document.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <b>Settings</b> menu, click <b>Default</b>. </li>
        <li>Click <b>No</b> on the form asking if you want to save the current settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The document settings in this instance of Skyline have now been reset to the default.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this tutorial covers a small molecule topic, you can choose the molecule interface by doing the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the user interface control in the upper right-hand corner of the Skyline window, and click <b>Molecule interface</b> which
            looks like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <img src="../../shared/en/molecule-interface.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Skyline is operating in molecule mode which is displayed by the molecule icon <img src="../../shared/molecule-icon.png" /> in the upper
        right-hand corner of the Skyline window. Its original proteomics menus and controls are now hidden, allowing you to focus on small molecule
        analysis.
    </p>
    <h1>Importing a Molecule Transition List into a Skyline Document</h1>
    <p>
        The easiest way to get a molecule transition list into a Skyline document is to start with an empty document and use the <b>Edit &gt;
            Insert &gt; Transition List</b> menu item. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At a minimum, Skyline needs to know the charge state and either the ion formula or <i>m/z</i> for each precursor and product. If no product
        ion information is present in a transition list, it is assumed to be a list of precursor targets. Repeated precursor information with
        different product information is assumed to indicate multiple transitions of a single precursor, just as with peptides.
    </p>
    <h3>A note on ion formulas and adduct descriptions</h3>
    <p>
        In proteomics applications, Skyline can safely assume ionization by protonation. So, all that is needed to describe a charged peptide is its
        sequence and charge state. For generalized molecules, however, ionization can be achieved in a variety of ways (sodium gain, hydrogen loss,
        etc.). Such ionization modes can be specified in Skyline using adduct descriptions of the style described at <a target="_blank"
            href="http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator/">http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator/</a>,
        e.g “[M+Na]”, “[M-2H]”, “[2M+ACN+H]”, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adduct descriptions can also be used to indicate that a molecule is isotopically labeled. For example, the adduct “[M3Cl374H2-Na]” indicates
        that the molecule has three Cl atoms replaced by 37Cl, and four H atoms replaced by deuterium, and the molecule is ionized by loss of Na.
    </p>
    <p>
        For molecules where the formula is unknown, a mass shift can be indicated by adduct. For example, “[M(-1.23)+H]” indicates that the molecule’s
        mass is 1.23 AMU less than its unaltered form, and the molecule is ionized by hydrogen gain.
    </p>
    <p>
        For molecules where the means of ionization is unknown, an adduct can indicate just a charge. For example, “[M+3]” indicates charge state
        three. The <i>m/z</i> value will be 1/3 of the molecule mass. While it is possible to describe your transition list completely in terms of
        <i>m/z</i> values for both precursors and products, without a chemical formula Skyline cannot provide isotopic distributions. So chemical
        formulas for both the neutral molecule and adduct descriptions are preferred.
    </p>

    <h2>Further notes on ion formulas and adduct descriptions</h2>
    <p>
        In this example, there are some light-heavy isotope label pairs, e.g. Methionine and d3-Methionine. In the transition list they are described
        as <b>C5H11NO2S [M+H]</b> and <b>C5H8H'3NO2S [M+H]</b>, but using the language of adduct descriptions they could also have
        been described as <b>C5H11NO2S [M+H]</b> and <b>C5H11NO2S [M3H2+H]</b>. You can see an example of this in the
        Phenylalanine heavy-light pair: the formulas are the same but the heavy adduct description specifies that 6 carbons are replaced with C13.
        Note that the Adduct column is optional: as in the example of Spermidine, the adduct can be given as part of the ion formula. Note also that
        the Precursor Charge column is not actually needed: the charge states can be inferred from the adduct descriptions. The Label column is also
        not strictly needed: the heavy label can be inferred from the precursor ion formula and/or adduct.

            provide the best import performance.</li>
        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
        <li>Select all 18 raw data folders in the tutorial folder by clicking the first listed and then holding down the Shift key and clicking the
            last.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="keep-next">
        The <b>Import Results Files</b> form should look like this:

         <img src="s-4.png" />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the <b>Open</b> button.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Import Results</b> form, choose the <b>Do not remove</b> option when asked about removing the common prefix.

        <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The files are a metabolite extract of cancer cell lines under specific amino acid deprivation conditions, where cells were deprived of either
        the amino acid Methionine, or Arginine, or both, for a period of 3 hours versus control (all amino acids).<sup>1</sup>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, you have learned how to create a Skyline document that targets molecules specified as precursor ion chemical formulas and
        adducts, and product ion <i>m/z</i> values. You imported a multi-replicate data set collected by a metabolomics researcher, and saw how many
        existing Skyline features created initially for targeted proteomics use can now be applied to non-proteomic molecule data.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This tutorial introduces Skyline's peak boundary imputation feature for PRM experiments. You will learn how to transfer peak boundaries from
        replicates where a peptide was confidently identified to replicates where it was not, enabling Skyline to integrate the chromatographic signal
        and produce measured peak areas. This is particularly valuable for group comparisons, where missing values can reduce statistical power or
        introduce bias depending on how they are handled.

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        To start this tutorial, download the following ZIP file:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://skyline.ms/tutorials/PeakBoundaryImputation-PRM.zip">https://skyline.ms/tutorials/PeakBoundaryImputation-PRM.zip</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Extract the files in it to a folder on your computer, like:
    </p>
    <p>
        C:\Users\brendanx\Documents

    <p>
        This will create a new folder:
    </p>
    <p>
        C:\Users\brendanx\Documents\PeakBoundaryImputation-PRM
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the file "TRX-Pelt-Plate4.sky" in the "PeakImputationDia" folder.</li>
    </ul>

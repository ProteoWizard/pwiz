            <summary>
            A TreeListView combines an expandable tree structure with list view columns.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>To support tree operations, two delegates must be provided:</para>
            <list>
            <item>CanExpandGetter. This delegate must accept a model object and return a boolean indicating
            if that model should be expandable. </item>
            <item>ChildrenGetter. This delegate must accept a model object and return an IEnumerable of model
            objects that will be displayed as children of the parent model. This delegate will only be called
            for a model object if the CanExpandGetter has already returned true for that model.</item>
            </list>
            <para>
            The top level branches of the tree are set via the Roots property. SetObjects(), AddObjects() 
            and RemoveObjects() are interpreted as operations on this collection of roots.
            </para>
            <para>
            To add new children to an existing branch, make changes to your model objects and then
            call RefreshObject() on the parent.
            </para>
            <para>The tree must be a directed acyclic graph -- no cycles are allowed.</para>
            <para>More generally, each model object must appear only once in the tree. If the same model object appears in two
            places in the tree, the control will become confused.</para>
            </remarks>
        </member>
        <member name="T:BrightIdeasSoftware.VirtualObjectListView">
            <summary>
            A virtual object list view operates in virtual mode, that is, it only gets model objects for
            a row when it is needed. This gives it the ability to handle very large numbers of rows with
            minimal resources.
            </summary>
            <remarks><para>A listview is not a great user interface for a large number of items. But if you've
            ever wanted to have a list with 10 million items, go ahead, knock yourself out.</para>
            <para>Virtual lists can never iterate their contents. That would defeat the whole purpose.</para>
            <para>Animated GIFs should not be used in virtual lists. Animated GIFs require some state
            information to be stored for each animation, but virtual lists specifically do not keep any state information.
            In any case, you really do not want to keep state information for 10 million animations!</para>
            <para>
            Although it isn't documented, .NET virtual lists cannot have checkboxes. This class codes around this limitation,
            but you must use the functions provided by ObjectListView: CheckedObjects, CheckObject(), UncheckObject() and their friends. 
            If you use the normal check box properties (CheckedItems or CheckedIndicies), they will throw an exception, since the
            list is in virtual mode, and .NET "knows" it can't handle checkboxes in virtual mode.
            </para>
            <para>
            The "CheckBoxes" property itself can be set once, but trying to unset it later will throw an exception.
            </para>
            <para>Due to the limits of the underlying Windows control, virtual lists do not trigger ItemCheck/ItemChecked events. 
            Use a CheckStatePutter instead.</para>

        <member name="T:BrightIdeasSoftware.ObjectListView">
            <summary>
            An object list displays 'aspects' of a collection of objects in a listview control.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            The intelligence for this control is in the columns. OLVColumns are
            extended so they understand how to fetch an 'aspect' from each row
            object. They also understand how to sort by their aspect, and
            how to group them.
            </para>
            <para>
            Aspects are extracted by giving the name of a method to be called or a
            property to be fetched. These names can be simple names or they can be dotted
            to chain property access e.g. "Owner.Address.Postcode".
            Aspects can also be extracted by installing a delegate.
            </para>
            <para>
            Sorting by column clicking and grouping by column are handled automatically.
            </para>
            <para>
            Right clicking on the column header should present a popup menu that allows the user to
            choose which columns will be visible in the list. This behaviour can be disabled by
            setting SelectColumnsOnRightClick to false.
            </para>
            <para>
            This list puts sort indicators in the column headers to show the column sorting direction.
            On Windows XP and later, the system standard images are used.
            If you wish to replace the standard images with your own images, put entries in the small image list
            with the key values "sort-indicator-up" and "sort-indicator-down".

            Changes made to the list are NOT reflected in the ListView itself -- it is pointless to add
            or remove groups to/from this list. Such modifications will do nothing.
            To do such things, you must listen for
            BeforeCreatingGroups or AboutToCreateGroups events, and change the list of
            groups in those events.

            <summary>
            When resizing a column by dragging its divider, should any space filling columns be
            resized at each mouse move? If this is false, the filling columns will be
            updated when the mouse is released.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            In previous versions, setting this to true produced ugly behaviour, because every
            column to the right of the divider being dragged was updated twice: once when
            the column be resized changes size (this moves all the columns slightly to the right);
            then again when the filling columns are updated - they are shrunk
            so that the combined width is not more than the control, so everything jumps slightly back to the left again.
            </para>
            <para>
            But, as of v2.0, the change the Windows messages in place, so there is now only one update,
            and everything looks nice and smooth.
            </para>
            <para>
            However, it still looks odd when the space filling column
            is in the left of the column that is being resized: the right edge of the column is dragged, but
            its <b>left</b> edge moves, since the space filling column is shrinking.
            </para>
            <para>Given the above behavior is probably best to turn this property off if your space filling
            columns aren't the right-most columns.</para>

            <para>
            This differs from its base version by explicitly preserving selection.
            The base class (ObjectListView) stores the selection state in the ListViewItem
            objects, so when they are sorted, the selected-ness is automatically preserved.
            But a virtual list only knows which indices are selected, so the same rows are
            selected after sorting, even if they are showing different objects. So, we have
            to specifically remember which objects were selected, and then reselected them
            afterwards. 
            </para>
            <para>
            For large lists when many objects are selected, this re-selection
            is the slowest part of sorting the list.

            A FastObjectListView is implemented as a virtual list with some of the virtual modes limits (e.g. no sorting)

            <list>
            <item>shows groups</item>
            <item>use Tile view</item>

            A DataListView is a ListView that can be bound to a datasource (which would normally be a DataTable or DataView).

            <remarks>
            <para>This listview keeps itself in sync with its source datatable by listening for change events.</para>
            <para>If the listview has no columns when given a data source, it will automatically create columns to show all of the datatables columns.
            This will be only the simplest view of the world, and would look more interesting with a few delegates installed.</para>
            <para>This listview will also automatically generate missing aspect getters to fetch the values from the data view.</para>
            <para>Changing data sources is possible, but error prone. Before changing data sources, the programmer is responsible for modifying/resetting
            the column collection to be valid for the new data source.</para>
            <para>Internally, a CurrencyManager controls keeping the data source in-sync with other users of the data source (as per normal .NET
            behavior). This means that the model objects in the DataListView are DataRowView objects. If you write your own AspectGetters/Setters,
            they will be given DataRowView objects.</para>

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            This class can only be used on plain ObjectListViews and FastObjectListViews.

            </para>
            <para>
            This class works when the OLV is sorted or grouped, but it is up to the programmer
            to decide what rearranging such lists "means". Example: if the control is grouping
            students by academic grade, and the user drags a "Fail" grade student into the "A+"
            group, it is the responsibility of the programmer to makes the appropriate changes
            to the model and redraw/rebuild the control so that the users action makes sense.
            </para>
            <para>
            Users of this class should listen for the CanDrop event to decide
            if models from another OLV can be moved to OLV under this sink.

            What proportion of the unoccupied horizontal space in the control should be given to this column?
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            There are situations where it would be nice if a column (normally the rightmost one) would expand as
            the list view expands, so that as much of the column was visible as possible without having to scroll
            horizontally (you should never, ever make your users have to scroll anything horizontally!).
            </para>
            <para>
            A space filling column is resized to occupy a proportion of the unoccupied width of the listview (the
            unoccupied width is the width left over once all the the non-filling columns have been given their space).
            This property indicates the relative proportion of that unoccupied space that will be given to this column.
            The actual value of this property is not important -- only its value relative to the value in other columns.
            For example:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>
            If there is only one space filling column, it will be given all the free space, regardless of the value in FreeSpaceProportion.
            </item>
            <item>
            If there are two or more space filling columns and they all have the same value for FreeSpaceProportion,
            they will share the free space equally.

<h2>Defining tracers in Topograph</h2>

Topograph allows a scientist to be very specific in describing the mass
characteristics of the tracers that they are using.&nbsp; Most
experiments will use only one tracer, but Topograph has the flexibility
to specify more than one tracer.<br>

A tracer is either a modified form of an amino acid, or a different
isotope of an element.<br>

When defining the tracer, the scientist specifies the mass difference
from the tracer from the natural form of the amino acid, or the mass
difference from the most abundant isotope of the element.<br>

If the tracer is an amino acid, Topograph can take into account that
the heavy isotopes in the tracer may not be 100% pure.&nbsp; Topograph
allows the scientist to specify the number of heavy atoms in the amino
acid, and the percentage of those atoms that are expected to be the
isotope that they are supposed to be.<br>

<br>

Topograph also asks whether the tracer elutes earlier or later than the
tracee.&nbsp; In the future it will make use of this information when
looking for the chromatogram peak.<br>

<br>

<h2>Adding peptide search results to Topograph</h2>

After creating a workspace peptide search results can be added to the
workspace.&nbsp; Topograph understands two formats of search results:<br>

DTASelect-filter.txt: Topograph adds each of the peptides identified in
the file into the workspace.<br>

Sequest: Topograph allows you to specify the minimum XCorr value for
peptide id's to be added to the workspace.&nbsp; <br>

It also allows you to specify that only search results for peptides
which are already in the workspace should be added.&nbsp; Use this if a
DTASelect-filter.txt file was already added to the workspace, but the
DTASelect-filter.txt file did not include all of the peptide IDs for
all of the samples.<br>

Topograph looks for the .RAW file by walking up the tree from where the
search results were found.&nbsp; If the .RAW file cannot be found at
the time that the search results are being added, the user will be
prompted to browse for the file when creating analyses.<br>

When adding search results to the workspace, Topograph remembers, for
each peptide in each file, the range of charges that the peptide was
found with, and the earliest and latest scan number.<br>

<br>

<h2>Creating peptide analyses</h2>

To tell Topograph which peptides to analyze, click the "Analyze
Peptides" button from either the Peptides view or the PeptideAnalyses
view.&nbsp; The dialog comes up asking how to filter the set of
peptides that are to be analyzed.<br>

There are two questions that are asked:<br>

Minimum tracer count<br>

Typically, one only wants to analyze peptides which can contain at
least one tracer.<br>

Exclude amino acids<br>

Topograph has a difficult time analyzing peptides which contain Q or N,
since these amino acids are often deamidated, resulting in a one dalton
increase in the peptide mass.<br>

When creating peptide analyses, Topograph finds the .RAW files, and
reads from the .RAW file the times of all of the scans.&nbsp; If
Topograph cannot find the .RAW file, the user is prompted to browse for
the .RAW file.&nbsp; If the user chooses not to browse for the .RAW
file, Topograph marks the file with the validation status
"reject".&nbsp; The file will be ignored from future operations.<br>

To change the validation status of a file, do so in the "Data Files"
view.<br>

<h2>Running jobs</h2>

After peptide analyses have been created, Topograph begins generating
chromatograms for the peptide analyses.&nbsp; To view the status of
jobs that are running in the background use the "View|Running Jobs"
menu item.&nbsp; This shows the status of chromatogram generation, and
result calculation.<br>

Changing some settings in the workspace will invalidate the
chromatograms that have been generated.&nbsp; Changing the mass of the
tracers that have been defined, or the static modifications do
so.&nbsp; If such settings have been changed, the chromatogram
generating thread will stop doing work until the workspace has been
saved.<br>

The result calculator thread is responsible for calculating the amount
of tracers that are present in the peptides, and for calculating the
half life of the tracers.&nbsp; Changing the initial or final
enrichment of a tracer definition or changing the time point or cohort
of a MsDataFile will invalidate results that have already been
calculated.<br>

<br>

<h2>How Topograph Generates Chromatograms</h2>

Topograph generates chromatograms by looking at individual spectra in
the .RAW file.&nbsp; Topograph begins the chromatogram 1800 scans
before where the peptide was first identified, and continues it until
1800 scans after the last id.&nbsp; Topograph only looks at MS1
scan.&nbsp; Because most .RAW files have 5 MS2 scans for every MS1
scan, this results in a chromatogram that has 300 points before the
first ID for that peptide, and 300 points after the last ID.<br>

If the spectrum was not saved as centroided data, Topograph centroids
the data itself.&nbsp; The centroiding algorithm is to divide the
spectrum by valleys (points where the first derivative goes from
negative to positive).&nbsp; The intensities for each of these peaks is
the sum of the intensities between the valleys, and the location of the
peak is the average of these point, weighted by their intensity.<br>

For each M/Z that Topograph is generating a chromatogram for, Topograph
remembers the intensity and M/Z of the nearest peak.<br>

There is a workspace setting which controls the mass accuracy.&nbsp; If
a chromatogram point's peak M/Z differs from the M/Z of interest by
more than the mass accuracy, Topograph treats that chromatogram point
as 0.<br>

The mass accuracy of the workspace can be changed without having to
regenerate the chromatograms.<br>

<h2>How
Topograph decides which chromatograms to generate</h2>

In order to determine which chromatograms to generate for a particular
peptide, Topograph determines what combinations of tracers could be
present in the peptide.&nbsp; In a typical experiment with only one
type of tracer amino acid, if the peptide sequence contains 3 of these
amino acids, Topograph will consider the expected mass distribution of
the peptide if 0, 1, 2, or 3 of those amino acids were the tracer.<br>

After determining this list of mass distributions, Topograph considers
only those masses which are over 1% abundant for some combination of
tracers.<br>

There will be masses that are very close to each other, for instance
the form of the peptide with one D3 Leucine tracer, and the natural
form of the peptide that has three 13C atoms in it.&nbsp; For masses
that are less than 0.1 daltons apart, Topograph will only generate one
chromatogram.&nbsp; For each point in the chromatogram, Topograph will
remember the peak which is closest to the bottom of that mass range,
and the top of that mass range.&nbsp; Often, these will be the same
peak.<br>

<br>

<h2>How Topograph determines chromatographic peak extent<br>
</h2>

Topograph currently determines the extent of a chromatographic peak by
starting at the scan where the peptide was identified, and proceeding
in each direction until every chromatogram has had at least one point
where the intensity was 0.<br>
If the peptide was identified in more than one scan, then Topograph
ensures that the peak contains all of the scans where the peptide was
identified.&nbsp; However, if there are more than 100 MS1 scans between
where the peptide was first identified and was last identified, then
Topograph only includes the first scan.<br>

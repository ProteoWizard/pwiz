# Cursor project orientation for ProteoWizard (pwiz)
# 
# This file provides Cursor-specific behavior guidance.
# For detailed coding conventions, style guidelines, and testing patterns,
# see STYLEGUIDE.md - the comprehensive style guide used by all AI tools.
# For project context, common gotchas, and architectural patterns,
# see MEMORY.md - essential context for AI tools working on this project.

[CRITICAL_FOR_AI_TOOLS]
# READ THESE FILES AT THE START OF EVERY CONVERSATION AND AFTER ANY CONTEXT RESET/SUMMARY:
# 
# 1. MEMORY.md - DRY principle, common patterns, architectural decisions, project gotchas
# 2. STYLEGUIDE.md - Code style, file headers, testing patterns, localization, file I/O (FileSaver)
# 3. TESTING.md - Test structure, AbstractFunctionalTestEx helpers, translation-proof testing
# 4. WORKFLOW.md - Git workflow, TODO lifecycle, branch management
#
# These files contain essential context that MUST be maintained across conversation summaries.
# When writing code or tests, actively apply the principles documented in these files:
# - DRY: Extract common patterns into parameterized helpers (see MEMORY.md examples)
# - Use AbstractFunctionalTestEx helpers (TestMessageDlgShownContaining, TestHttpClientCancellation, etc.)
# - Always use resource strings for assertions (never hardcoded English)
# - Always use FileSaver for atomic file writes (see STYLEGUIDE.md)
# - Follow established patterns in similar existing code
#
# If you notice yourself writing repetitive code or tests, STOP and refactor to be DRY.

name = "ProteoWizard (pwiz)"
description = "C++ libraries and tools for proteomics; native builds via MSVC/GCC and Boost.Build"
primary_languages = ["C++", "C#", "Jam", "Batch", "Shell"]

[on_open]
message = "Use quickbuild.bat on Windows to build. Do not introduce new build systems. Respect existing indentation and avoid unrelated reformatting."

[paths]
code_roots = [
  "pwiz/",

]

[rules]
- Prefer `quickbuild.bat` on Windows; pass non-interactive flags where applicable.
- Keep code style intact: do not reformat unrelated files; preserve tabs/spaces.
- When adding sources, update the appropriate Jamfile or Visual Studio project.
- Use existing vendor libraries from `libraries/`; do not fetch replacements.
- For documentation, add concise notes to `README.md` and `doc/`.
- Project conventions: See MEMORY.md for essential project context and common gotchas.

[assistant_behaviors]
- Provide minimal, actionable explanations.
- Use fenced code blocks only for relevant snippets or commands.
- Default to read-only discovery before edits; then apply focused edits.
- When referring to the person working with the AI, use "the developer" not "the user".
  - "The user" refers to end-users of Skyline software.
  - "The developer" refers to the person pair-programming with the AI.
  - This avoids confusion when discussing both developers and end-users in the same conversation.

[async_patterns]
# See STYLEGUIDE.md for comprehensive async/await guidelines
reference = "STYLEGUIDE.md"

[build_and_testing]
- LLM agents CANNOT build or run this project directly.
- Build and test operations must be performed by the developer using Visual Studio.
- When code changes are made, request that the developer build and test the changes.
- Do not attempt to run quickbuild.bat, bs.bat, or any build commands.
- Do not attempt to run tests or execute the application.

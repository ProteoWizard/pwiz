# AI Documentation Index

This directory contains detailed supplementary documentation for LLM-assisted development.

## Overview

The `ai/` folder structure separates essential context from detailed documentation:
- **ai/*.md** - Core files (<200 lines each): CRITICAL-RULES, MEMORY, WORKFLOW, STYLEGUIDE, TESTING
- **ai/docs/*.md** - Detailed documentation (unlimited size): full coding standards, architecture, edge cases, historical context

## Supplementary Documentation (Read On-Demand)

This section will be populated during Phase 6 with links to:
- **style-guide.md**: Detailed coding standards and examples
- **architecture.md**: System design and component relationships
- **edge-cases.md**: Special scenarios and legacy handling
- **testing-patterns.md**: Test fixture patterns and conventions
- **historical.md**: Rationale for decisions ("why we do X")

## When to Read What

- Before writing new code: style-guide.md
- Before major refactoring: architecture.md
- When handling legacy data: edge-cases.md
- Before writing tests: testing-patterns.md
- When wondering "why": historical.md

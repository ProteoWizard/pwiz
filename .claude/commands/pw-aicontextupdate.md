description: Update ai-context branch from master (quick merge)
---
Update the ai-context branch from master to get the latest code and documentation changes.

This is a common operation with no implications - it simply brings master's changes into ai-context.

Run this command:
```powershell
pwsh -File ./ai/scripts/sync-ai-context.ps1 -Direction FromMaster -Push
```

After syncing, briefly summarize what new changes came from master.

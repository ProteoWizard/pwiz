             When adding an entry from a file or directory, these quantities are
             automatically set from the filesystem values. When adding an entry from a

             application may wish to set these values to some arbitrary value, before
             saving the archive.  If you set the times using this method, the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.LastModified" /> property also gets set, to the same value provided for

            The ZipEntry has methods that extract the entry to an already-opened stream, writing
            data to a stream your application provides.  This is an alternative method for those
            applications that wish to read data directly from the stream.

            read-only stream - you can use it as you would any stream.  The data you get will be
            decrypted and decompressed.  The one additional feature the CrcCalculatorStream adds
            is that it calculates a CRC32 on the bytes of the stream as it is read.  This CRC
            *should* be used by the application to validate the content of the ZipEntry, when the
            read is complete.  You don't have to validate the CRC, but you should. Check the
            example for how to do this.

             The DotNetZip library sets the LastModified value for an entry, equal to the
             Last Modified time of the file in the filesystem.  If an entry is added from
             a stream, in which case no Last Modified attribute is available, the library
             uses <c>System.DateTime.Now</c> for this value, for the given entry.
             </para>
        <para>
             This property allows the application to retrieve and possibly set the
             LastModified value on an entry, to an arbitrary value.  <see cref="T:System.DateTime" /> values with a <see cref="T:System.DateTimeKind" />
             setting of <c>DateTimeKind.Unspecified</c> are taken to be expressed as
             <c>DateTimeKind.Local</c>.
             </para>
        <para>
             Be aware that because of the way the PKZip specification describes how times
             are stored in the zip file, the full precision of the <c>System.DateTime</c>
             datatype is not stored for the last modified time when saving zip files.
             For more information on how times are formatted, see the PKZip
             specification.
             </para>
        <para> The actual last modified time of a file can be stored in two ways in the
             zip file: first in the so-called "DOS" format, which has a 2-second
             precision. Values are rounded to the nearest even second. For example, if the
             time on the file is 12:34:43, then it will be stored as 12:34:44. This first
             value is accessible via the <c>LastModified</c> property.  Also, the last
             modified time can optionally be stored as an 8-byte integer quantity expressed
             as the number of 1/10 milliseconds (in other words the number of 100 nanosecond
             units) since January 1, 1601 (UTC).  This is the so-called Win32 time.  This
             time is accessible via the <c>Mtime</c> property.  Zip tools and libraries will
             always at least handle (read or write) the DOS time, and may also handle the
             Win32 time. When reading ZIP files, The DotNetZip library reads the Win32 time,
             if it is stored in the entry, and sets both <c>LastModified</c> and <c>Mtime</c>
             to that value. When writing ZIP files, the DotNetZip library will write both
             time quantities.</para>
        <para>
             The last modified time of the file created upon a call to
             <c>ZipEntry.Extract()</c> may be adjusted during extraction to compensate
             for differences in how the .NET Base Class Library deals with daylight
             saving time (DST) versus how the Windows filesystem deals with daylight
             saving time.  Raymond Chen <see href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/24/55413.aspx">provides
             some good context</see>.
             </para>
        <para>
             In a nutshell: Daylight savings time rules change regularly.  In 2007, for
             example, the inception week of DST changed.  In 1977, DST was in place all
             year round. In 1945, likewise.  And so on.  Win32 does not attempt to guess
             which time zone rules were in effect at the time in question.  It will
             render a time as "standard time" and allow the app to change to DST as
             necessary.  .NET makes a different choice.
             </para>
        <para>
             Compare the output of FileInfo.LastWriteTime.ToString("f") with what you
             see in the Windows Explorer property sheet for a file that was last
             written to on the other side of the DST transition. For example, suppose
             the file was last modified on October 17, 2003, during DST but DST is not
             currently in effect. Explorer's file properties reports Thursday, October
             17, 2003, 8:45:38 AM, but .NETs FileInfo reports Thursday, October 17,
             2003, 9:45 AM.
             </para>
        <para>
             Win32 says, "Thursday, October 17, 2002 8:45:38 AM PST". Note: Pacific
             STANDARD Time. Even though October 17 of that year occurred during Pacific
             Daylight Time, Win32 displays the time as standard time because that's
             what time it is NOW.
             </para>
        <para>
             .NET BCL assumes that the current DST rules were in place at the time in
             question.  So, .NET says, "Well, if the rules in effect now were also in
             effect on October 17, 2003, then that would be daylight time" so it
             displays "Thursday, October 17, 2003, 9:45 AM PDT" - daylight time.
             </para>
        <para>
             So .NET gives a value which is more intuitively correct, but is also
             potentially incorrect, and which is not invertible. Win32 gives a value
             which is intuitively incorrect, but is strictly correct.
             </para>
        <para>
             Because of this funkiness, this library adds one hour to the LastModified
             time on the extracted file, if necessary.  That is to say, if the time in
             question had occurred in what the .NET Base Class Library assumed to be
             DST. This assumption may be wrong given the constantly changing DST
             rules, but it is the best we can do.

      <summary>
             Last Modified time for the file represented by the entry.
             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para> This value corresponds to the "last modified" time in the NTFS file times
             as described in <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">the Zip
             specification</see>.  This value is different from <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.LastModified" />.
             </para>
        <para> Let me explain. Originally, waaaaay back in 1989 when the ZIP
             specification was originally described by the esteemed Mr. Phil Katz, the
             dominant operating system of the time was MS-DOS. MSDOS stored file times with a
             2-second precision, because, c'mon, <em>who is ever going to need better
             resolution than THAT?</em> And so ZIP files, regardless of the platform on which
             the zip file was created, store file times in exactly <see href="http://www.vsft.com/hal/dostime.htm">the same format that DOS used in
             1989</see>.  </para>
        <para> Since then, the ZIP spec has evolved, but the internal format for file
             timestamps remains the same.  Despite the fact that the way times are stored in
             a zip file is rooted in DOS heritage, any program on any operating system can
             format a time in this way, and most zip tools and libraries DO - they round file
             times to the nearest even second and store it just like DOS did 20 years ago.
             </para>
        <para> PKWare extended the ZIP specification to allow a zip file to store what
             is called "NTFS Times" for a file.  These are the <em>last write</em>, <em>last
             access</em>, and <em>file creation</em> times of a particular file. These
             metadata are not actually specific to NTFS. They are tracked for each file by
             NTFS, but they are also tracked by other filesystems. DotNetZip represents this
             with the <c>Mtime</c>, <c>Atime</c> and <c>Ctime</c> properties on a
             <c>ZipEntry</c>.</para>
        <para> Inside a zip file, these three distinct timestamps are stored in the same
             format that Windows NTFS uses to store file times. Rather than a resolution of 2
             seconds, NTFS times have a resolution of 100 nanoseconds. And, just as with the
             DOS time, any tool or library on any operating system is capable of formatting a
             time in this way and embedding it into the zip file. The key is, not all zip
             tools or libraries do.  Storing the higher-precision times for each entry is
             optional for zip files, and many tools and libraries don't use the option,
             though it is much nicer than the DOS time.  And futher, there are also cases
             where the timestamp of the file entry is not known, and is not stored. For
             example, this happens when content for the entry is obtained from a stream.  The
             bottom line is that the higher-resolution time is not guaranteed to be present
             for a ZipEntry.  The old DOS time, represented by <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.LastModified" />, is
             guaranteed to be present, though it sometimes unset. </para>
        <para> Ok, getting back to the question about how the <c>LastModified</c>
             property relates to this <c>Mtime</c> property... <c>LastModified</c> is always
             set, while <c>Mtime</c> is not. (The other times stored in the <em>NTFS times
             extension</em>, <c>Ctime</c> and <c>Atime</c> also may not be set on an entry
             that is read from an existing zip file.) When reading a zip file, then
             <c>LastModified</c> takes the DOS time that is stored with the file. If the DOS time
             has been stored as zero in the zipfile, then this library will use
             <c>DateTime.Now</c> for the <c>LastModified</c> value.  If the ZIP file was
             created by an evolved tool, then there will also be NTFS times in the zip file.
             In that case, this library will read those times, and set <c>LastModified</c>
             and <c>Mtime</c> to the same value, the one corresponding to the last write time
             of the file.  If there are no "NTFS times" stored for the entry, then
             <c>Mtime</c> remains unset (likewise <c>Atime</c> and <c>Ctime</c>), and
             <c>LastModified</c> keeps its DOS time. </para>
        <para> When creating zip files with this library, then the NTFS time properties
             (<c>Mtime</c>, <c>Atime</c>, and <c>Ctime</c>) are always set on the ZipEntry
             instance, and these data are always stored in the zip archive for each entry. If
             you add an entry from an actual filesystem file, then the entry gets the actual
             NTFS times for that file.  If you add an entry from a stream, or a string, then
             the times get the value <c>DateTime.Now</c>.  In this case <c>LastModified</c>
             and <c>Mtime</c> will be identical, to 2 seconds of precision.  You can
             explicitly set the <c>Ctime</c>, <c>Atime</c>, and <c>Mtime</c> of an entry
             using <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.SetNtfsTimes(System.DateTime,System.DateTime,System.DateTime)" />. Those changes
             are not made permanent in the zip file until you call <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save" /> or one of its cousins.  </para>
        <para>
             And that is why <c>Mtime</c> may or may not be meaningful, and it may or may not agree 
             exactly with the <c>LastModified</c> time on the <c>ZipEntry</c>.
             </para>

        <para>
             The <see cref="T:System.IO.FileAttributes">attributes</see> in NTFS include
             ReadOnly, Archive, Hidden, System, and Indexed.  When adding a ZipEntry to a
             ZipFile, these attributes are set implicitly when adding an entry from the
             filesystem.  When adding an entry from a stream or string, the Attributes are
             not set.
             </para>
        <para>
             When reading a ZipEntry from a ZipFile, the attributes are set according to the data
             stored in the ZipFile. If you extract the entry from the archive to a disk file,
             DotNetZip will set the attributes on the resulting file accordingly.
             </para>
        <para>
             The attributes can be set explicitly by the application for whatever purpose.  For
             example the application may wish to set the FileAttributes.ReadOnly bit for all
             entries added to an archive, so that on unpack, this attribute will be set on the
             extracted file.  Any changes you make to this property are made permanent only when
             you call a Save() method on the ZipFile instance that contains the ZipEntry.
             </para>
        <para>
             For example, an application may wish to zip up a directory and set the ReadOnly bit on
             every file in the archive, so that upon later extraction, the resulting files will be
             marked as ReadOnly.  Not every extraction tool respects these attributes, but if you
             unpack with DotNetZip, then the attributes will be set as they are stored in the
             ZipFile.
             </para>
        <para>
             These attributes may not be interesting or useful if the resulting archive is
             extracted on a non-Windows platform.  How these attributes get used upon extraction

             The stream that provides content for the ZipEntry.
             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para> The application can use this property to set the input stream for an
             entry on a just-in-time basis. Imagine a scenario where the application
             creates a <c>ZipFile</c> comprised of content obtained from hundreds of
             files, via calls to <c>AddFile()</c>. The DotNetZip library opens streams on
             these files on a just-in-time basis, only when writing the entry out to an
             external store within the scope of a <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> call.  Only one
             input stream is opened at a time, as each entry is being written
             out. </para>
        <para> Now imagine a different application that creates a zipfile with
             content obtained from hundreds of streams, added through <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddFileFromStream(System.String,System.String,System.IO.Stream)" />.
             Normally the application would supply an open stream to that call.  But when
             large numbers of streams are being added, this can mean many open streams at
             one time, unnecessarily.  </para>
        <para> To avoid this, at the time of calling
             <c>ZipFile.AddFileFromStream</c> for each entry, the application can supply
             Stream.Null as the value of the stream parameter. The application
             can then open the stream on a just-in-time basis, setting this property, and
             thus insuring, as with the latter example, that only one stream need be
             opened at a time while constructing and saving the ZipFile.  </para>
        <para> To do this, the application should set the <c>InputStream</c>
             property within the context of the <see cref="E:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.SaveProgress" /> event,
             when the event type is <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipProgressEventType.Saving_BeforeWriteEntry" />. The application
             should only set <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.InputStream" /> for a ZipEntry which has the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Source" /> equal to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntrySource.Stream" />.  When
             the input stream is provided by the application in this way, the application
             is also responsible for closing or disposing the stream.  This would
             normally be done in the <see cref="E:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.SaveProgress" /> event, when the
             event type is <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipProgressEventType.Saving_AfterWriteEntry" />. See
             the example code provided here for how this can be done. </para>
        <para> Setting the value of this property when the entry was not added from
             a stream (for example, when the ZipEntry was added with <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddFile(System.String)" /> or <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddDirectory(System.String)" />, or when the entry was added by
             reading an existing zip archive) will throw an exception.  </para>

        <para>
             When creating a zip archive, an application can obtain content for one or more of the
             ZipEntry instances from streams, using the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddFileFromStream(System.String,System.String,System.IO.Stream)" /> method.  At the
             time of calling that method, the application can supply null as the value of the
             stream parameter.  By doing so, the application indicates to the library that it will
             provide a stream for the entry on a just-in-time basis, at the time one of the
             <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> methods is called and the data for the various entries are being
             compressed and written out.
             </para>
        <para>
             In this case, the application can set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.InputStream" /> property,
             typically within the SaveProgress event (event type: <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipProgressEventType.Saving_BeforeWriteEntry" />) for that entry.  
             </para>
        <para>
             The application will later want to call Close() and Dispose() on that stream.  In the
             SaveProgress event, when the event type is <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipProgressEventType.Saving_AfterWriteEntry" />, the application can do so.  This
             flag indicates that the stream has been provided by the application on a just-in-time
             basis and that it is the application's responsibility to call Close/Dispose on that
             stream.

             When writing a zipfile, you can specify either 0x08 (Deflate) or 0x00 (None).  If you 
             try setting something else, you will get an exception.

             the default behavior - compression is used where it makes sense.  
             The second entry, the MP3 file, is added to the archive without being compressed.

        <para>
             In some cases, applying the Deflate compression algorithm in DeflateStream can
             result an increase in the size of the data.  This "inflation" can happen with
             previously compressed files, such as a zip, jpg, png, mp3, and so on.  In a few
             tests, inflation on zip files can be as large as 60%!  Inflation can also happen
             with very small files.  In these cases, by default, the DotNetZip library
             discards the compressed bytes, and stores the uncompressed file data into the
             zip archive.  This is an optimization where smaller size is preferred over

        <para>
             In some cases, neither choice is optimal.  The application wants compression,

        <para> According to <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">the Zip

             libraries do not follow the specification, and instead encode characters using
             the system default code page, or an arbitrary code page.  For example, WinRAR
             when run on a machine in Shanghai may encode filenames with the Chinese (Big-5)
             code page.  This behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but it occurs
             anyway.  This property exists to support that non-compliant behavior when
             reading or writing zip files.  </para>
        <para>
             When writing zip archives that will be read by one of these other archivers, use
             this property to specify the code page to use when encoding filenames and comments
             into the zip file, when the IBM437 code page will not suffice.
             </para>
        <para> Be aware that a zip file created after you've explicitly specified the
             code page will not be compliant to the PKWare specification, and may not be
             readable by compliant archivers.  On the other hand, many archivers are
             non-compliant and can read zip files created in arbitrary code pages. For
             example, if you run WinRar on your PC desktop in Kyoto, Japan, you will probably be
             able to open Zip files that we encoded by DotNetZip in the Shift_JIS code page.
             </para>
        <para> When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no
             standard way for the creator (DotNetZip) to specify in the zip file which code
             page has been used. DotNetZip is not able to inspect the zip file and determine
             the codepage used for the entries within it. Therefore, you, the application
             author, must determine that.  If you read a zip file using a codepage other than
             the one used to encode the zipfile, this may result in filenames that are not
             legal in the filesystem, and you will get exceptions during calls to

      <remarks>
        <para>
             The ZIP format includes a provision for specifying whether an entry in the
             zip archive is a text or binary file.  Such a distinction may seem irrelevant
             now, but some zip tools or libraries, in particular older PKUnzip on IBM
             mainframes, require this bit to be set in order to unzip text and binary
             files properly.  Set this property to true to set the Text bit for an entry
             that represents a text file, if you want your zip files to be readable by
             these older zip tools and libraries.
             </para>
        <para>
             When writing a zip file, you must set the property before calling
             <c>Save()</c> on the ZipFile.
             </para>
        <para>
             If you are not having compatibility problems with zip archives, you can
             safely ignore this property.

      <summary> 
            This class implements the "traditional" or "classic" PKZip encryption,
            which today is considered to be weak. On the other hand it is
            ubiquitous. This class is intended for use only by the DotNetZip library.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
            Most uses of the DotNetZip library will not involve direct calls into the
            ZipCrypto class.  Instead, the ZipCrypto class is instantiated and used by
            the ZipEntry() class when encryption or decryption on an entry is employed.
            If for some reason you really wanted to use a weak encryption algorithm
            in some other application, you might use this library.  But you would be much
            better off using one of the built-in strong encryption libraries in the 
            .NET Framework, like the AES algorithm or SHA.

             Key(0) := 305419896 (0x12345678)

             Then, initialize the keys with a password:
             
             loop for i from 0 to length(password)-1
                 update_keys(password(i))

             To create a new zip archive, an application can call this constructor, passing the
             name of a file that does not exist.  The name may be a fully qualified path. Then the
             application can add directories or files to the ZipFile via <c>AddDirectory()</c>,
             <c>AddFile()</c>, <c>AddItem()</c> and then write the zip archive to the disk by
             calling <c>Save()</c>. The zip file is not actually opened and written to the disk
             until the application calls <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>.  At that point the new zip file
             with the given name is created.
             </para>
        <para>
             If you won't know the name of the zipfile until the time you call
             <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>, or if you plan to save to a stream (which has no name), then
             you should use the no-argument constructor.
             </para>
        <para>
             The application can also call this constructor to read an existing zip archive.
             passing the name of a valid zip file that does exist. But, it's better form to use the
             static <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Read(System.String)" /> method, passing the name of the zip file,
             because using <c>ZipFile.Read()</c> in your code communicates very clearly what you
             are doing.  In either case, the file is then read into the <c>ZipFile</c> instance.
             The app can then enumerate the entries or can modify the zip file, for example adding
             entries, removing entries, changing comments, and so on.

             One advantage to this parameterized constructor: it allows applications to use the

        <para>
             This version of the constructor allows the caller to pass in a TextWriter, and an
             Encoding.  The TextWriter will collect verbose messages that are generated by the
             library during extraction or creation of the zip archive.  A console application
             may wish to pass System.Console.Out to get messages on the Console. A graphical or
             headless application may wish to capture the messages in a different
             <c>TextWriter</c>, for example, a <c>StringWriter</c>, and then display the

             This method opens the specified zip file, reads in the zip archive, verifying

             This example shows how to read a zip file using the Big-5 Chinese code page (950), 
             and extract each entry in the zip file.
             For this code to work as desired, the zipfile must have been created using the big5
             code page (CP950). This is typical, for example, when using WinRar on a machine with
             CP950 set as the default code page.  In that case, the names of entries within the Zip
             archive will be stored in that code page, and reading the zip archive must be done
             using that code page.  If the application did not use the correct code page in
             ZipFile.Read(), then names of entries within the zip archive would not be correctly
             retrieved.

             This example shows how to Read zip content from a stream, and extract
             one entry into a different stream. In this example, the filename
             "NameOfEntryInArchive.doc", refers only to the name of the entry
             within the zip archive.  A file by that name is not created in the
             filesystem.  The I/O is done strictly with the given streams.

             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>
             This method selects files from the the current working directory matching the specified
             criteria, and adds them to the ZipFile.  The selection does not recurse into
             subdirectories.
             </para>
        <para>
             Specify the criteria in statements of 3 elements: a noun, an operator, and a value.
             Consider the string "name != *.doc" .  The noun is "name".  The operator is "!=",
             implying "Not Equal".  The value is "*.doc".  That criterion, in English, says "all
             files with a name that does not end in the .doc extension."
             </para>
        <para>
             Supported nouns include "name" for the filename; "atime", "mtime", and "ctime" for
             last access time, last modfied time, and created time of the file, respectively;
             "attributes" for the file attributes; and "size" for the file length (uncompressed).
             The "attributes" and "name" nouns both support = and != as operators.  The "size",
             "atime", "mtime", and "ctime" nouns support = and !=, and &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=
             as well. The times are taken to be expressed in "local time". 
             </para>
        <para>
             Specify values for the file attributes as a string with one or more of the
             characters H,R,S,A in any order, implying Hidden, ReadOnly, System, and Archive,
             respectively.  To specify a time, use YYYY-MM-DD-HH:mm:ss as the format.  If you
             omit the HH:mm:ss portion, it is assumed to be 00:00:00 (midnight). The value for a
             size criterion is expressed in integer quantities of bytes, kilobytes (use k or kb
             after the number), megabytes (m or mb), or gigabytes (g or gb).  The value for a
             name is a pattern to match against the filename, potentially including wildcards.
             The pattern follows CMD.exe glob rules: * implies one or more of any character,
             while ? implies one character.  If the name pattern contains any slashes, it is
             matched to the entire filename, including the path; otherwise, it is matched
             against only the filename without the path.  This means a pattern of "*\*.*" matches 
             all files one directory level deep, while a pattern of "*.*" matches all files in 
             all directories.  
             </para>
        <para>
             To specify a name pattern that includes spaces, use single quotes around the pattern.
             A pattern of "'* *.*'" will match all files that have spaces in the filename.  The full 
             criteria string for that would be "name = '* *.*'" . 
             </para>
        <para>
             Some examples: a string like "attributes != H" retrieves all entries whose
             attributes do not include the Hidden bit.  A string like "mtime &gt; 2009-01-01"
             retrieves all entries with a last modified time after January 1st, 2009.  For
             example "size &gt; 2gb" retrieves all entries whose uncompressed size is greater
             than 2gb.
             </para>
        <para>
             You can combine criteria with the conjunctions AND or OR. Using a string like "name
             = *.txt AND size &gt;= 100k" for the selectionCriteria retrieves entries whose names
             end in  .txt, and whose uncompressed size is greater than or equal to
             100 kilobytes.
             </para>
        <para>
             For more complex combinations of criteria, you can use parenthesis to group clauses
             in the boolean logic.  Without parenthesis, the precedence of the criterion atoms is
             determined by order of appearance.  Unlike the C# language, the AND conjunction does
             not take precendence over the logical OR.  This is important only in strings that
             contain 3 or more criterion atoms.  In other words, "name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000
             or attributes = H" implies "((name = *.txt AND size &gt; 1000) OR attributes = H)"
             while "attributes = H OR name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000" evaluates to "((attributes
             = H OR name = *.txt) AND size &gt; 1000)".  When in doubt, use parenthesis.
             </para>
        <para>
             Using time properties requires some extra care. If you want to retrieve all entries
             that were last updated on 2009 February 14, specify a time range like so:"mtime
             &gt;= 2009-02-14 AND mtime &lt; 2009-02-15".  Read this to say: all files updated
             after 12:00am on February 14th, until 12:00am on February 15th.  You can use the
             same bracketing approach to specify any time period - a year, a month, a week, and
             so on.
             </para>
        <para>
             The syntax allows one special case: if you provide a string with no spaces, it is
             treated as a pattern to match for the filename.  Therefore a string like "*.xls"
             will be equivalent to specifying "name = *.xls".
             </para>
        <para>
             There is no logic in this method that insures that the file inclusion criteria are
             internally consistent.  For example, it's possible to specify criteria that says
             the file must have a size of less than 100 bytes, as well as a size that is
             greater than 1000 bytes. Obviously no file will ever satisfy such criteria, but
             this method does not detect such logical inconsistencies. The caller is
             responsible for insuring the criteria are sensible.

             "content" in the zip archive itself. When the zip archive is unzipped, the folder
             containing the .psd files will be named "content".

      <summary>
             Size of the IO Buffer used while saving.
             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para> First, let me say that you really don't need to bother with this.  It is
                 here to allow for optimizations that you probably won't make! It will work
                 fine if you don't set or get this property at all.  Ok?  </para>
        <para> Now that we have <em>that</em> out of the way, the fine print: This
                 property affects the size of the buffer that is used for I/O for each entry
                 contained in the zip file. When a file is read in to be compressed, it uses
                 a buffer given by the size here.  When you update a zip file, the data for
                 unmodified entries is copied from the first zip file to the other, through a
                 buffer given by the size here. </para>
        <para> Changing the buffer size affects a few things: first, for larger buffer
                 sizes, the memory used by the ZipFile, obviously, will be larger during I/O
                 operations.  This may make operations faster for very much larger files.
                 Last,
                 for any given entry, when you use a larger buffer there will be fewer
                 progress events during I/O operations, because there's one progress event
                 generated for each time the buffer is filled and then emptied.</para>
        <para> The default buffer size is 8k.  Increasing the buffer size may speed
                 things up as you compress larger files.  But there are no hard-and-fast
                 rules here, eh?  You won't know til you test it.  And there will be a limit
                 where ever larger buffers actually slow things down.  So as I said in the
                 beginning, it's probably best if you don't set or get this property at
                 all.</para>
      </remarks>
      <example>
             This example shows how you might set a large buffer size for efficiency when
             dealing with zip entries that are larger than 1gb.

             When the ZipFile instance was created by reading an archive using one of the
             ZipFile.Read methods, this property represents the name of the zipfile that was read.
             When the ZipFile instance was created by using the no-argument constructor, this value
             is null (Nothing in VB).
             </para>
        <para>
             If you use the no-argument constructor, and you then explicitly set this property,
             when you call <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save" />, this name will specify the name of the
             zipfile created.  Doing so is equivalent to calling <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save(System.String)" />.  When instantiating a ZipFile by reading from a stream
             or byte array, the Name property remains null.  When saving to a stream, the Name

            The compression level setting is used at the time of Save(). The same level is applied
            to all ZipEntry instances contained in the ZipFile during the save.  If you do not set
            this property, the default compression level is used, which normally gives a good
            balance of compression efficiency and compression speed.  In some tests, using
            BEST_COMPRESSION can double the time it takes to compress, while delivering just a
            small increase in compression efficiency.  This behavior will vary with the type of
            data you compress.  If you are in doubt, just leave this setting alone, and accept the
            default.

             The zip spec does not describe how to encode the comment string in a code page other

             IBM437.  However, there are situations where you want an encoded Comment, for example
             using code page 950 "Big-5 Chinese".  DotNetZip will encode the comment in the code
             page specified by <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" />, at the time of the call

          <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">The PKWare zip
             specification</see> provides for encoding file names and file comments in either the
             IBM437 code page, or in UTF-8.  This flag selects the encoding according to that
             specification.  By default, this flag is false, and filenames and comments are encoded
             into the zip file in the IBM437 codepage.  Setting this flag to true will specify that
             filenames and comments that cannot be encoded with IBM437 will be encoded with UTF-8.
             </para>
        <para>
             Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare specification with respect to
             UTF-8 encoding can contain entries with filenames containing any combination of
             Unicode characters, including the full range of characters from Chinese, Latin,
             Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, and many other alphabets.  However, because at this time, the
             UTF-8 portion of the PKWare specification is not broadly supported by other zip
             libraries and utilities, such zip files may not be readable by your favorite zip tool
             or archiver. In other words, interoperability will decrease if you set this flag to
             true.
             </para>
        <para>
             In particular, Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare specification
             with respect to UTF-8 encoding will not work well with Explorer in Windows XP or
             Windows Vista, because Windows compressed folders, as far as I know, do not support
             UTF-8 in zip files.  Vista can read the zip files, but shows the filenames
             incorrectly. Unpacking from Windows Vista Explorer will result in filenames that have
             rubbish characters in place of the high-order UTF-8 bytes.
             </para>
        <para>
             Also, zip files that use UTF-8 encoding will not work well with Java applications that
             use the java.util.zip classes, as of v5.0 of the Java runtime. The Java runtime does
             not correctly implement the PKWare specification in this regard.
             </para>
        <para>
             As a result, we have the unfortunate situation that "correct" behavior by the
             DotNetZip library with regard to Unicode encoding of filenames during zip
             creation will result in zip files that are readable by strictly compliant and
             current tools (for example the most recent release of the commercial WinZip
             tool); but these zip files will not be readable by various other tools or
             libraries, including Windows Explorer.
             </para>
        <para>
             The DotNetZip library can read and write zip files with UTF8-encoded entries,
             according to the PKware spec.  If you use DotNetZip for both creating and reading the
             zip file, and you use UTF-8, there will be no loss of information in the
             filenames. For example, using a self-extractor created by this library will allow you
             to unpack files correctly with no loss of information in the filenames.
             </para>
        <para>
             If you do not set this flag, it will remain false.  If this flag is false, your
             ZipFile will encode all filenames and comments using the IBM437 codepage.  This can
             cause "loss of information" on some filenames, but the resulting zipfile will be more
             interoperable with other utilities. As an example of the loss of information,
             diacritics can be lost.  The o-tilde character will be down-coded to plain o.  The c
             with a cedilla (Unicode 0xE7) used in Portugese will be downcoded to a c.  Likewise,
             the O-stroke character (Unicode 248), used in Danish and Norwegian, will be down-coded
             to plain o. Chinese characters cannot be represented in codepage IBM437; when using
             the default encoding, Chinese characters in filenames will be represented as ?. These
             are all examples of "information loss".
             </para>
        <para>
             The loss of information associated to the use of the IBM437 encoding is inconvenient,
             and can also lead to runtime errors. For example, using IBM437, any sequence of 4
             Chinese characters will be encoded as ????.  If your application creates a ZipFile,
             then adds two files, each with names of four Chinese characters each, this will result
             in a duplicate filename exception.  In the case where you add a single file with a
             name containing four Chinese characters, calling Extract() on the entry that has
             question marks in the filename will result in an exception, because the question mark
             is not legal for use within filenames on Windows.  These are just a few examples of
             the problems associated to loss of information.
             </para>
        <para>
             This flag is independent of the encoding of the content within the entries in the zip
             file. Think of the zip file as a container - it supports an encoding.  Within the
             container are other "containers" - the file entries themselves.  The encoding within
             those entries is independent of the encoding of the zip archive container for those
             entries.
             </para>
        <para>
             Rather than specify the encoding in a binary fashion using this flag, an application
             can specify an arbitrary encoding via the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" />
             property.  Setting the encoding explicitly when creating zip archives will result in
             non-compliant zip files that, curiously, are fairly interoperable.  The challenge is,
             the PKWare specification does not provide for a way to specify that an entry in a zip
             archive uses a code page that is neither IBM437 nor UTF-8.  Therefore if you set the
             encoding explicitly when creating a zip archive, you must take care upon reading the
             zip archive to use the same code page.  If you get it wrong, the behavior is undefined
             and may result in incorrect filenames, exceptions, stomach upset, hair loss, and acne.

      <remarks>
        <para>
             Designed many years ago, the <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">original zip
             specification from PKWARE</see> allowed for 32-bit quantities for the compressed and
             uncompressed sizes of zip entries, as well as a 32-bit quantity for specifying the
             length of the zip archive itself, and a maximum of 65535 entries.  These limits are
             now regularly exceeded in many backup and archival scenarios.  Recently, PKWare added
             extensions to the original zip spec, called "ZIP64 extensions", to raise those
             limitations.  This property governs whether the ZipFile instance will use those
             extensions when writing zip archives within a call to one of the Save() methods.  The
             use of these extensions is optional and explicit in DotNetZip because, despite the
             status of ZIP64 as a bona fide standard, many other zip tools and libraries do not
             support ZIP64, and therefore a zip file saved with ZIP64 extensions may be unreadable
             by some of those other tools.
             </para>
        <para>
             Set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Always" /> to always use ZIP64 extensions
             when saving, regardless of whether your zip archive needs it.  Suppose you add 5 files,
             each under 100k, to a ZipFile.  If you specify Always for this flag before calling the
             Save() method, you will get a ZIP64 archive, though you do not need to use ZIP64
             because none of the original zip limits had been exceeded.
             </para>
        <para>
             Set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Never" /> to tell the DotNetZip library to
             never use ZIP64 extensions.  This is useful for maximum compatibility and
             interoperability, at the expense of the capability of handling large files or large
             archives.  NB: Windows Explorer in Windows XP and Windows Vista cannot currently
             extract files from a zip64 archive, so if you want to guarantee that a zip archive
             produced by this library will work in Windows Explorer, use <c>Never</c>. If you set
             this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Never" />, and your application creates a zip
             that would exceed one of the ZIP limits, the library will throw an exception during the
             Save().
             </para>
        <para>
             Set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.AsNecessary" /> to tell the DotNetZip
             library to use the zip64 extensions when required by the entry. After the file is
             compressed, the original and compressed sizes are checked, and if they exceed the
             limits described above, then zip64 can be used. That is the general idea, but there is
             an additional wrinkle when saving to a non-seekable device, like the ASP.NET
             <c>Response.OutputStream</c>, or <c>Console.Out</c>.  When using non-seekable streams
             for output, the entry header - which indicates whether zip64 is in use - is emitted
             before it is known if zip64 is necessary.  It is only after all entries have been saved
             that it can be known if ZIP64 will be required.  On seekable output streams, after
             saving all entries, the library can seek backward and re-emit the zip file header to be
             consistent with the actual ZIP64 requirement.  But using a non-seekable output stream,
             the library cannot seek backward, so the header can never be changed. In other words,
             the archive's use of ZIP64 extensions is not alterable after the header is emitted.
             Therefore, when saving to non-seekable streams, using <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.AsNecessary" /> is the same as using <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Always" />:
             it will always produce a zip archive that uses zip64 extensions.
             </para>
        <para>
             The default value for the property is <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Never" />. <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.AsNecessary" /> is safest, in the sense that you will not get an
             Exception if a pre-ZIP64 limit is exceeded.
             </para>
        <para>
             You may set the property at any time before calling Save(). 
             </para>
        <para>
             The ZipFile.Read() method will properly read ZIP64-endowed zip archives, regardless of
             the value of this property.  DotNetZip will always read ZIP64 archives.  This property
             governs whether DotNetZip will write them. Therefore, when updating archives, be careful
             about setting this property after reading an archive that may use ZIP64 extensions.

        <para>
             The use of ZIP64 extensions within an archive is not always necessary, and for
             interoperability concerns, it may be desired to NOT use ZIP64 if possible.  The
             <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.UseZip64WhenSaving" /> property can be set to use ZIP64
             extensions only when necessary.  In those cases, Sometimes applications want to
             know whether a Save() actually used ZIP64 extensions.  Applications can query
             this read-only property to learn whether ZIP64 has been used in a just-saved
             ZipFile.

             Non-null values (HasValue is true) indicate whether ZIP64 extensions were used during

             In its AppNote.txt document, PKWare describes how to specify in the zip entry
             header that a filename or comment containing non-ANSI characters is encoded with
             UTF-8.  But, some archivers do not follow the specification, and instead encode
             super-ANSI characters using the system default code page.  For example, WinRAR
             when run on a machine in Shanghai may encode filenames with the Big-5 Chinese
             (950) code page.  This behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but it
             occurs anyway.
             </para>
        <para>
             When using DotNetZip to write zip archives that will be read by one of these other
             archivers, set this property to specify the code page to use when encoding the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.FileName" /> and <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Comment" /> for each ZipEntry in the
             zip file, for values that cannot be encoded with the default codepage for zip files,
             IBM437.  This is why this property is "provisional".  In all cases, IBM437 is used
             where possible, in other words, where no loss of data would result. It is possible,
             therefore, to have a given entry with a Comment encoded in IBM437 and a FileName
             encoded with the specified "provisional" codepage.

             Be aware that a zip file created after you've explicitly set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> property to a value other than IBM437 may not be
             compliant to the PKWare specification, and may not be readable by compliant archivers.
             On the other hand, many (most?) archivers are non-compliant and can read zip files
             created in arbitrary code pages.  The trick is to use or specify the proper codepage
             when reading the zip.
             </para>
        <para>
             When creating a zip archive using this library, it is possible to change the value of
             <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> between each entry you add, and between
             adding entries and the call to Save(). Don't do this. It will likely result in a
             zipfile that is not readable.  For best interoperability, either leave <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> alone, or specify it only once, before adding
             any entries to the ZipFile instance.  There is one exception to this recommendation,
             described later.
             </para>
        <para>
             When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no standard way for
             the creator application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip, WinRar, or something else - to
             formally specify in the zip file which codepage has been used for the entries. As a
             result, readers of zip files are not able to inspect the zip file and determine the
             codepage that was used for the entries contained within it.  It is left to the
             application or user to determine the necessary codepage when reading zipfiles encoded
             this way.  If you use an incorrect codepage when reading a zipfile, you will get
             entries with filenames that are incorrect, and the incorrect filenames may even contain
             characters that are not legal for use within filenames in Windows. Extracting entries
             with illegal characters in the filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too bad, but
             this is just the way things are with code pages in zip files. Caveat Emptor.
             </para>
        <para>
             When using DotNetZip to read a zip archive, and the zip archive uses an arbitrary code
             page, you must specify the encoding to use before or when the zipfile is READ.  This
             means you must use a ZipFile.Read() method that allows you to specify a
             System.Text.Encoding parameter.  Setting the ProvisionalAlternateEncoding property
             after your application has read in the zip archive will not affect the entry names of
             entries that have already been read in, and is probably not what you want.
             </para>
        <para>
             And now, the exception to the rule described above.  One strategy for specifying the
             code page for a given zip file is to describe the code page in a human-readable form in
             the Zip comment. For example, the comment may read "Entries in this archive are encoded
             in the Big5 code page".  For maximum interoperability, the Zip comment in this case
             should be encoded in the default, IBM437 code page.  In this case, the zip comment is
             encoded using a different page than the filenames.  To do this, specify
             ProvisionalAlternateEncoding to your desired region-specific code page, once before
             adding any entries, and then reset ProvisionalAlternateEncoding to IBM437 before
             setting the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Comment" /> property and calling Save().

      <example>
             This example shows how to read a zip file using the Big-5 Chinese code page (950), 
             and extract each entry in the zip file.
             For this code to work as desired, the zipfile must have been created using the big5
             code page (CP950). This is typical, for example, when using WinRar on a machine with
             CP950 set as the default code page.  In that case, the names of entries within the Zip
             archive will be stored in that code page, and reading the zip archive must be done
             using that code page.  If the application did not use the correct code page in
             ZipFile.Read(), then names of entries within the zip archive would not be correctly
             retrieved.

      <remarks>
        <para> 
             When saving an entry into a zip archive, the DotNetZip by default compresses the
             file. That's what a ZIP archive is all about, isn't it?  For files that are already
             compressed, like MP3's or JPGs, the deflate algorithm can actually slightly expand the
             size of the data.  Setting this property to trye allows you to specify that
             compression should not be used.  The default value is false.
             </para>
        <para>
             Do not construe setting this flag to false as "Force Compression".  Setting it to
             false merely does NOT force No compression.  If you want to force the use of the
             deflate algorithm when storing each entry into the zip archive, define a <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.WillReadTwiceOnInflation" /> callback, which always returns false, and a <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.WantCompression" /> callback that always returns true.  This is probably the
             wrong thing to do, but you could do it. Forcing the use of the Deflate algorithm when
             storing an entry does not guarantee that the data size will get smaller. It could
             increase, as described above.
             </para>

             When writing a zip archive, this password is applied to the entries, not
             to the zip archive itself. It applies to any ZipEntry subsequently added 
             to the ZipFile, using one of the AddFile, AddDirectory, or AddItem methods. 
             When reading a zip archive, this property applies to any entry subsequently

        <para>
             When writing a zip archive, keep this in mind: though the password is set on the
             ZipFile object, according to the Zip spec, the "directory" of the archive - in
             other words the list of entries contained in the archive - is not encrypted with
             the password, or protected in any way.  IF you set the Password property, the
             password actually applies to individual entries that are added to the archive,
             subsequent to the setting of this property.  The list of filenames in the
             archive that is eventually created will appear in clear text, but the contents
             of the individual files are encrypted.  This is how Zip encryption works.
             </para>
        <para>
             If you set the password on the zip archive, and then add a set of files to the 
             archive, then each entry is encrypted with that password.  You may also want 
             to change the password between adding different entries. If you set the 
             password, add an entry, then set the password to null, and add another entry,
             the first entry is encrypted and the second is not.
             </para>
        <para>
             When setting the Password, you may also want to explicitly set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Encryption" /> property, to specify how to encrypt the entries added to the
             ZipFile.  If you set the Password to a non-null value and do not set <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Encryption" />, then PKZip 2.0 ("Weak") encryption is used.  This
             encryption is relatively weak but is very interoperable. If you set the password
             to a null value (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), Encryption is reset to None.

        <para>
             All of the preceding applies to writing zip archives - when you use one of the
             Save methods.  To use this property when reading or an existing ZipFile -
             calling Extract methods on the ZipFile or the ZipEntry instances - do the
             following: set the Password property, then call one of the ZipFile.Extract()
             overloads. In this case, the entry is extracted using the Password that is
             specified on the ZipFile instance. If you have not set the Password property,
             then the password is null, and the entry is extracted with no password.
             </para>
        <para> If you set the Password property on the ZipFile, then call Extract() an
             entry that has not been encrypted with a password, the password is not
             used for that entry, and the ZipEntry is extracted as normal. In other words,
             the password is used only if necessary. </para>

             In some cases, applying the Deflate compression algorithm in <c>DeflateStream</c> can
             result an increase in the size of the data.  This "inflation" can happen with
             previously compressed files, such as a zip, jpg, png, mp3, and so on.  In a few
             tests, inflation on zip files can be as large as 60%!  Inflation can also happen
             with very small files.  In these cases, by default, the DotNetZip library
             discards the compressed bytes, and stores the uncompressed file data into the
             zip archive.  This is an optimization where smaller size is preferred over
             longer run times.
             </para>
        <para>
             The application can specify that compression is not even tried, by setting the
             ForceNoCompression flag.  In this case, the compress-and-check-sizes process as
             decribed above, is not done.
             </para>
        <para>
             In some cases, neither choice is optimal.  The application wants compression,
             but in some cases also wants to avoid reading the stream more than once.  This
             may happen when the stream is very large, or when the read is very expensive, or
             when the difference between the compressed and uncompressed sizes is not
             significant.
             </para>
        <para>
             To satisfy these applications, this delegate allows the DotNetZip library to ask
             the application to for approval for re-reading the stream, in the case where
             inflation occurs.  The callback is invoked only in the case of inflation; that
             is to say when the uncompressed stream is smaller than the compressed stream.

        <para>
             As with other properties (like <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Password" /> and <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ForceNoCompression" />), setting the corresponding delegate on a ZipFile instance
             will caused it to be applied to all ZipEntry items that are subsequently added to the
             ZipFile instance. In other words, if you set this callback after you have added files
             to the ZipFile, but before you have called Save(), those items will not be governed by
             the callback when you do call Save(). Your best bet is to set this callback before
             adding any entries.
             </para>

             Of course, if you want to have different callbacks for different entries, you may do so.

      </remarks>
      <example>
        <para>
             In this example, the application callback checks to see if the difference
             between the compressed and uncompressed data is greater than 25%.  If it is,
             then the callback returns true, and the application tells the library to re-read
             the stream.  If not, then the callback returns false, and the library just keeps
             the "inflated" file data.

      <remarks>
        <para>
             In some cases, applying the Deflate compression algorithm to an entry *may*
             result a slight increase in the size of the data.  This "inflation" can
             happen with previously compressed files, such as a zip, jpg, png, mp3, and
             so on; it results from adding DEFLATE framing data around incompressible data.
             Inflation can also happen with very small files. Applications may wish to
             avoid the use of compression in these cases. As well, applications may wish
             to avoid compression to save time.
             </para>
        <para>
             By default, the DotNetZip library takes this approach to decide whether to
             apply compression: first it applies a heuristic, to determine whether it
             should try to compress a file or not.  The library checks the extension of
             the entry, and if it is one of a known list of uncompressible file types
             (mp3, zip, docx, and others), the library will not attempt to compress the
             entry.  The library does not actually check the content of the entry.  If
             you name a text file "Text.mp3", and then attempt to add it to a zip
             archive, this library will, by default, not attempt to compress the entry,
             based on the extension of the filename.
             </para>
        <para>
             If this default behavior is not satisfactory, there are two options. First,
             the application can override it by setting this <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.WantCompression" /> callback.  This affords maximum control to
             the application.  With this callback, the application can supply its own
             logic for determining whether to apply the Deflate algorithm or not.  For
             example, an application may desire that files over 40mb in size are never
             compressed, or always compressed.  An application may desire that the first
             7 entries added to an archive are compressed, and the remaining ones are
             not.  The WantCompression callback allows the application full control, on
             an entry-by-entry basis.
             </para>
        <para>
             The second option for overriding the default logic regarding whether to
             apply compression is the ForceNoCompression flag.  If this flag is set to
             true, the compress-and-check-sizes process as decribed above, is not done,
             nor is the callback invoked.  In other words, if you set ForceNoCompression
             to true, andalso set the WantCompression callback, only the
             ForceNoCompression flag is considered.
             </para>
        <para>
             This is how the library determines whether compression will be attempted for 
             an entry.  If it is to be attempted, the library reads the entry, runs it through
             the deflate algorithm, and then checks the size of the result.  If applying
             the Deflate algorithm increases the size of the data, then the library
             discards the compressed bytes, re-reads the raw entry data, and stores the
             uncompressed file data into the zip archive, in compliance with the zip
             spec.  This is an optimization where smaller size is preferred over longer
             run times. The re-reading is gated on the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.WillReadTwiceOnInflation" /> callback, if it is set. This callback applies
             independently of the WantCompression callback.
             </para>
        <para>
             If by the logic described above, compression is not to be attempted for an entry, 
             the library reads the entry, and simply stores the entry data uncompressed.

             </summary>
      <remarks> Adding a large number of entries to a zip file can take a long
                 time.  For example, when calling <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddDirectory(System.String)" /> on a
                 directory that contains 50,000 files, it could take 3 minutes or so.
                 This event handler allws an application to track the progress of the Add
                 operation.  </remarks>
      <example>
        <code lang="C#">
            
             int _numEntriesToAdd= 0;
             int _numEntriesAdded= 0;

             FileSelector encapsulates logic that selects files from a source
             - a zip file or the filesystem - based on a set of criteria.  This class is used 
             internally by the DotNetZip library, but you may also find utility in using it

      <remarks>
        <para>
             Typically, an application that creates or manipulates Zip archives will not directly
             interact with the FileSelector class.  The FileSelector class is used internally by the
             ZipFile class for selecting files for inclusion into the ZipFile, when the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddSelectedFiles(System.String,System.String)" /> method is called.

        <para>
             But, some applications may wish to use the FileSelector class directly, to select
             files from disk volumes based on a set of criteria, without creating or querying Zip
             archives.  The file selection criteria include: a pattern to match the filename; the
             last modified, created, or last accessed time of the file; the size of the file; and
             the attributes of the file.

             The string specifying which files to include when retrieving.
             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>
             Specify the criteria in statements of 3 elements: a noun, an operator, and a value.
             Consider the string "name != *.doc" .  The noun is "name".  The operator is "!=",
             implying "Not Equal".  The value is "*.doc".  That criterion, in English, says "all
             files with a name that does not end in the .doc extension."
             </para>
        <para>
             Supported nouns include "name" for the filename; "atime", "mtime", and "ctime" for
             last access time, last modfied time, and created time of the file, respectively;
             "attributes" for the file attributes; and "size" for the file length (uncompressed).
             The "attributes" and "name" nouns both support = and != as operators.  The "size",
             "atime", "mtime", and "ctime" nouns support = and !=, and &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=
             as well.
             </para>
        <para>
             Specify values for the file attributes as a string with one or more of the
             characters H,R,S,A,I in any order, implying Hidden, ReadOnly, System, Archive,
             and NotContextIndexed, 
             respectively.  To specify a time, use YYYY-MM-DD-HH:mm:ss as the format.  If you
             omit the HH:mm:ss portion, it is assumed to be 00:00:00 (midnight). The value for a
             size criterion is expressed in integer quantities of bytes, kilobytes (use k or kb
             after the number), megabytes (m or mb), or gigabytes (g or gb).  The value for a
             name is a pattern to match against the filename, potentially including wildcards.
             The pattern follows CMD.exe glob rules: * implies one or more of any character,
             while ? implies one character.  If the name pattern contains any slashes, it is
             matched to the entire filename, including the path; otherwise, it is matched
             against only the filename without the path.  This means a pattern of "*\*.*" matches 
             all files one directory level deep, while a pattern of "*.*" matches all files in 
             all directories.    
             </para>
        <para>
             To specify a name pattern that includes spaces, use single quotes around the pattern.
             A pattern of "'* *.*'" will match all files that have spaces in the filename.  The full 
             criteria string for that would be "name = '* *.*'" . 
             </para>
        <para>
             Some examples: a string like "attributes != H" retrieves all entries whose
             attributes do not include the Hidden bit.  A string like "mtime &gt; 2009-01-01"
             retrieves all entries with a last modified time after January 1st, 2009.  For
             example "size &gt; 2gb" retrieves all entries whose uncompressed size is greater
             than 2gb.
             </para>
        <para>
             You can combine criteria with the conjunctions AND, OR, and XOR. Using a string like
             "name = *.txt AND size &gt;= 100k" for the selectionCriteria retrieves entries whose
             names end in .txt, and whose uncompressed size is greater than or equal to 100
             kilobytes.
             </para>
        <para>
             For more complex combinations of criteria, you can use parenthesis to group clauses
             in the boolean logic.  Absent parenthesis, the precedence of the criterion atoms is
             determined by order of appearance.  Unlike the C# language, the AND conjunction does
             not take precendence over the logical OR.  This is important only in strings that
             contain 3 or more criterion atoms.  In other words, "name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000
             or attributes = H" implies "((name = *.txt AND size &gt; 1000) OR attributes = H)"
             while "attributes = H OR name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000" evaluates to "((attributes
             = H OR name = *.txt) AND size &gt; 1000)".  When in doubt, use parenthesis.
             </para>
        <para>
             Using time properties requires some extra care. If you want to retrieve all entries
             that were last updated on 2009 February 14, specify "mtime &gt;= 2009-02-14 AND
             mtime &lt; 2009-02-15".  Read this to say: all files updated after 12:00am on
             February 14th, until 12:00am on February 15th.  You can use the same bracketing
             approach to specify any time period - a year, a month, a week, and so on.
             </para>
        <para>
             The syntax allows one special case: if you provide a string with no spaces, it is treated as
             a pattern to match for the filename.  Therefore a string like "*.xls" will be equivalent to 
             specifying "name = *.xls".  
             </para>
        <para>
             There is no logic in this class that insures that the inclusion criteria
             are internally consistent.  For example, it's possible to specify criteria that
             says the file must have a size of less than 100 bytes, as well as a size that

      <remarks>
        <para>
             PkzipWeak implies the use of Zip 2.0 encryption, which is known to be weak and
             subvertible.
             </para>
        <para>
             A note on interoperability: Values of PkzipWeak and None are specified in the
             PKWare AppNote.txt document, are considered to be "standard".  Zip archives
             produced using these options will be interoperable with many other zip tools and
             libraries, including Windows Explorer.
             </para>
        <para>
             Values of WinZipAes128 and WinZipAes256 are not part of the Zip specification,
             but rather imply the use of a vendor-specific extension from WinZip. If you
             want to produce interoperable Zip archives, do not use these values.  For
             example, if you produce a zip archive using WinZipAes256, you will be able to
             open it in Windows Explorer on Windows XP and Vista, but you will not be able
             to extract entries; trying this will lead to an "unspecified error". For this
             reason, some people have said that a zip archive that uses WinZip's AES
             encryption is not actually a zip archive at all.  A zip archive produced this
             way will be readable with the WinZip tool (Version 11 and beyond).
             </para>
        <para>
             There are other third-party tools and libraries, both commercial and
             otherwise, that support WinZip's AES encryption. These will be able to read
             AES-encrypted zip archives produced by DotNetZip, and conversely applications
             that use DotNetZip to read zip archives will be able to read AES-encrypted
             archives produced by those tools or libraries.  Consult the documentation for
             those other tools and libraries to find out if WinZip's AES encryption is
             supported.
             </para>
        <para>
             In case you care: According to the WinZip specification, the actual AES key used
             is derived from the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Password" /> via an algorithm that
             complies with <see href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt">RFC 2898</see>,
             using an iteration count of 1000.  The algorithm is sometimes referred to as
             PBKDF2, which stands for "Password Based Key Derivation Function #2".
             </para>
        <para>
             A word about password strength and length: The AES encryption technology is very
             good, but any system is only as secure as the weakest link.  If you want to
             secure your data, be sure to use a password that is hard to guess.  To make it
             harder to guess (increase its "entropy"), you should make it longer.  If you use
             normal characters from an ASCII keyboard, a password of length 20 will be strong
             enough that it will be impossible to guess.  For more information on that, I'd
             encourage you to read <see href="http://www.redkestrel.co.uk/Articles/RandomPasswordStrength.html">this
             article.</see></para>
        <para>
             The WinZip AES algorithms are not supported with the version of DotNetZip that
             runs on the .NET Compact Framework.  This is because .NET CF lacks the
             HMACSHA1 class that is required for producing the archive.

            This gauges the size of the sliding window, and hence the 
            compression effectiveness as well as memory consumption. It's best to just leave this 
            setting alone if you don't know what it is.  The maximum value is 15 bits, which implies
            a 32k window.

            The compression strategy to use.

      <remarks>
            This is only effective in compression.  The theory offered by ZLIB is that different
            strategies could potentially produce significant differences in compression behavior
            for different data sets.  Unfortunately I don't have any good recommendations for how
            to set it differently.  When I tested changing the strategy I got minimally different
            compression performance. It's best to leave this property alone if you don't have a
            good feel for it.  Or, you may want to produce a test harness that runs through the
            different strategy options and evaluates them on different file types. If you do that,
            let me know your results.

      <summary>
             A class for compressing and decompressing GZIP streams.
             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>
             The GZipStream is a <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorator</see> on a <see cref="T:System.IO.Stream" />.  It adds GZIP compression or decompression to any stream.
             </para>
        <para> Like the <c>System.IO.Compression.GZipStream</c> in the .NET Base
             Class Library, the Ionic.Zlib.GZipStream can compress while writing, or decompress
             while reading, but not vice versa.  The compression method used is GZIP, which is
             documented in <see href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">IETF RFC 1952</see>,
             "GZIP file format specification version 4.3".</para>
        <para> A GZipStream can be used to decompress data (through Read()) or to compress
             data (through Write()), but not both.  </para>
        <para> If you wish to use the GZipStream to compress data, you must wrap it around a
             write-able stream. As you call Write() on the GZipStream, the data will be
             compressed into the GZIP format.  If you want to decompress data, you must wrap the
             GZipStream around a readable stream that contains an IETF RFC 1952-compliant stream.
             The data will be decompressed as you call Read() on the GZipStream.  </para>
        <para> Though the GZIP format allows data from multiple files to be concatenated
             together, this stream handles only a single segment of GZIP format, typically
             representing a single file.  </para>
        <para>
             This class is similar to <see cref="T:Ionic.Zlib.ZlibStream" /> and <see cref="T:Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream" />.
             <c>ZlibStream</c> handles RFC1950-compliant streams.  <see cref="T:Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream" />
             handles RFC1951-compliant streams. This class handles RFC1952-compliant streams.

      <remarks> GZIP allows the storage of a last modified time with each GZIP entry.
             When compressing data, you can set this before the first call to Write().  When
             decompressing, you can retrieve this value any time after the first call to
             Read().  </remarks>

        <para>
            If you wish to use the GZipStream to compress data while writing, you can create a
            GZipStream with CompressionMode.Compress, and a writable output stream.  Then call
            Write() on that GZipStream, providing uncompressed data as input.  The data sent
            to the output stream will be the compressed form of the data written.  
            </para>
        <para>
            A GZipStream can be used for Read() or Write(), but not both. Writing implies compression.

        <para>
             The GZIP format allows for each file to optionally have an associated comment stored with the

             a GZIP stream you create, set this property before calling Write() for the first time
             on the GZipStream.

        <para>
             When using GZipStream to decompress, you can retrieve this property after the first

        <para>
            The GZIP format optionally allows each file to have an associated filename.  When
            compressing data (through Write()), set this FileName before calling Write() the first
            time on the GZipStream.  The actual filename is encoded into the GZIP bytestream with
            the ISO-8859-1 code page, according to RFC 1952. It is the application's responsibility to 
            insure that the FileName can be encoded and decoded correctly with this code page.

             The ZlibStream is a <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorator</see> on a <see cref="T:System.IO.Stream" />.  It adds ZLIB compression or decompression to any

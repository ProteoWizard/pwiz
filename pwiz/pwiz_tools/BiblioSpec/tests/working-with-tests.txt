BiblioSpec Tests

There are several pieces to the BiblioSpec tests: inputs, expected
outputs, source files, and invocations.  The inputs are data files
used by the tests (e.g. search results and spectrum files that get
built into a library).  The expected outputs are text files in
BiblioSpec/tests/reference.  A test passes if the output of the test
matches its expected output file.  The source files are small C++
programs that execute a test.  The invocations (for lack of a better
word) are the calls to the tests in Jamfile.jam.  I'll describe each
in detail. 

Inputs

All input files are in inputs.tar.bz2.  They are automatically
unpacked into BiblioSpec/tests/inputs by bjam as part of the
proteowizard build process. If you add or change an input file, be
sure to update the tar file and check the new version into the
repository.

Expected outputs

Most tests produce a file.  This file should match one of the files in
tests/reference/.  The comparison is done as part of the test.  If the
BiblioSpec code changes such that the output changes, simply update
the appropriate file in tests/reference/.

Invocations (Jamfile.jam)

The BiblioSpec tests are run automatically as part of the bjam build
process.  The tests are specified in
pwiz/pwiz_tools/BiblioSpec/tests/Jamfile.jam.  Each one is run with
the rule 'run-if-exists ( sources : options : inputs : properties :
name)'.  Here is an example with an explanation of the parts.

run-if-exists ExecuteBlib.cpp
  : -o
  : ../src//BlibBuild inputs/smaller.perc.xml output/perc.blib
  : 
  : build-perc-xml ;

Each test is it's own mini executable.  The source file for the
executable in this example is ExecuteBlib.cpp.  The name of the test
is build-perc-xml and will be compiled into an executable of that
name.  It can be found in 
<pwiz-root>/<build-dir>/pwiz_tools/BiblioSpec/tests/build-perc-xml.test/<toolset>/<set-of-properties>/build-perc-xml

After the test is compiled, it will be run with the given options, in
this case '-o'. It will also be given the arguments 'smaller.perc.xml'
and 'perc.blib'.  This particular test has no properties specified.

You can run the test just as bjam would with this command

[long path to]/build-perc-xml -o ../src//BlibBuild inputs/smaller.perc.xml output/perc.blib

There are a couple of peculiarities of bjam and the rule run-if-exists
to keep in mind.  The difference between the options and the inputs is
that the options can be any string and are passed to the test as-is
whereas the inputs must be files that bjam can find and are passed
with their fully-qualified path. This is handy in that you don't have
to worry about where the build directory is relative to the inputs,
but it means that the file must exist.  In some cases, the "input" is
really the name of an output file which may not exist yet.  To get
around this, we create an empty file that bjam can find.  For the
above example, it's accomplished with this line in Jamfile.jam

make output/perc.blib : inputs/empty : @common.copy : $(test_output_req) ;

Briefly, 'make' is a rule that creates a file.  The file will be named
output/perc.blib.  The source of that file is inputs/empty.  It will
be made with the rule @common.copy and it has the requirements in the
variable $(test_output_req). 

Another oddity of the inputs part of run-if-exists is that the files
must be listed alphabetically.  I have no explanation for this.  Bjam
complains if it isn't so.  This means in a few cases, the names are
chosen so they can be conveniently given alphabetically
(e.g. reference/zbuild.skip-lines).  More on this in the next section.

Source Files

There are three source files for running tests: ExecuteBlib.cpp,
CompareLibraryContents.cpp, CompareTextFiles.cpp.  Each one reproduces
a command-line task in the original version of these tests.  ExecuteBlib.cpp is
used to run one of the BiblioSpec tools as you might on the command
line.  CompareLibraryContents uses sqlite3 to extract information from
a BiblioSpec library and compare it to a text file.  CompareTextFiles
is basically a diff command that compares two text files, with some
added features.

Most tests come in pairs where first a BiblioSpec tool is run and then
its output is compared with the expected output.  The first test
confirms that the tool runs without error and the second test makes
sure that the output is correct. Since these pairs must be run in
order, the second one will have a dependency on the first.  Here is
the test paired with our above example: 

run-if-exists CompareLibraryContents.cpp compare-src
  :
  : output/perc.blib reference/perc-xml.check
  : $(compare-reqs)
    <dependency>build-perc-xml
  : check-perc-xml ;

It takes as input the output of build-perc-xml (output/perc.blib).  It
also requires that build-perc-xml be run before it
(<dependency>build-perc-xml).  

A few details about each of the test sources.  Each one will print a
usage statement when run with no arguments.  For example

ExecuteBlib <blib tool> [<inputs>+]

The first required argument is one of the BiblioSpec tools.  Following
that are the arguments and options that you would pass to those
tools.  In our first example, the -o will be passed to BlibBuild to
mean "overwrite any existing library".

Another oddity about run-if-exists is that the options and inputs will
not be passed to the test in the same order they were given in
Jamfile.jam.  But since we had to list them alphabetically,
ExecuteBlib will take advantage of that and sort them alphabetically
before passing them to the BiblioSpec tool.

CompareLibraryContents has this usage statement:

CompareLibraryContents <library> <expected output> [<skip>]

It requires a BiblioSpec library and a file with what the library
should contain (files in tests/reference/).  There is an optional file
with information about allowed tolerance.  The file might look like
this:

CompareDetails: 4       0.00005

Which would mean that if the value in column 4 is not the same between the
library and the reference file, call it the same if it differs by no
more than 0.00005.

The final test source is CompareTextFiles.cpp

CompareTextFiles <expected> <observed> [<skip lines>]

It requires two inputs, the expected output and the observed output.
It will also take an optional file with lines that can be skipped when
doing the comparison.  (This is to emulate the -I function in gnu diff.) Each
line of the skip file represents a line in the output that can be
skipped.  The lines must appear in the order they are expected.  Here
is an example skip file:

CreationDate
Library

The first line in the expected output containing the string
"CreationDate" will be skipped along with the corresponding line in the
observed file.  The next line following that containing "Library" will
be skipped.

The skip file may also begin with "CompareDetails" and information
about accepted tolerance of a column.
